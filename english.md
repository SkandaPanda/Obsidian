When a person stands up suddenly, circulation is affected by gravity, causing blood to pool in the legs and reducing the venous return to the heart. This leads to a momentary decrease in stroke volume and a subsequent drop in arterial blood pressure, which can cause insufficient oxygen supply to the brain (dizziness). The body counteracts this immediately through a very rapid regulatory mechanism called the **baroreceptor reflex**. This reflex restores blood pressure through an interplay between sensors, the brain, and the autonomic nervous system.

**Identification of the Lowered Blood Pressure** Regulation begins with the body's pressure sensors, known as **baroreceptors**, detecting the change. These receptors are stretch-sensitive nerve endings strategically located in the vessel walls at two main sites: the **aortic arch** (_arcus aortae_) and the **bifurcation of the carotid arteries** (_sinus caroticus_). Under normal conditions, these receptors continuously send signals (action potentials) to the brain. When blood pressure drops, the stretch in the vessel walls decreases, causing the baroreceptors to fire action potentials at a **lower frequency**.

**Processing in the Nervous System** The reduced signal frequency is interpreted by the **circulation center** (vasomotor center) located in the medulla oblongata. The circulation center responds to the low blood pressure by altering the balance of the autonomic nervous system:

1. Activity in the **parasympathetic nervous system decreases** (is inactivated).
    
2. Activity in the **sympathetic nervous system increases** significantly.
    

**Effectors Restoring Blood Pressure** The increased sympathetic output (and the decreased parasympathetic output) triggers a series of physiological reactions in the heart and blood vessels that collectively raise blood pressure:

- **Increased Heart Activity (Increased Cardiac Output):** Sympathetic nerves stimulate the sinus node to increase the impulse frequency, leading to an **increased heart rate**. Simultaneously, heart muscle cells are stimulated to contract more forcefully, resulting in **increased contractile force** and a larger stroke volume. Together, these actions increase the heart's cardiac output (the amount of blood pumped per minute), which directly raises blood pressure.
    
- **Constriction of Arterioles (Increased Resistance):** The sympathetic surge causes the smooth muscle in the body's arterioles to contract (**vasoconstriction**). This increases the **total peripheral resistance** in the circulatory system. Since blood pressure depends on the difficulty blood faces when leaving the arteries, increased resistance leads to a rise in arterial pressure.
    
- **Constriction of Veins (Increased Return):** Finally, sympathetic stimulation also causes the walls of the veins to contract (**venoconstriction**). This pushes "stored" blood from the veins back toward the heart, resulting in an **increased venous return**. The increased return fills the heart more effectively, which, according to the Frank-Starling mechanism, further contributes to an increased stroke volume.
    

In summary, the combination of increased heart rate, increased stroke volume, increased peripheral resistance, and increased venous return leads to the rapid restoration of arterial blood pressure to normal levels, thereby securing blood flow to the brain.
