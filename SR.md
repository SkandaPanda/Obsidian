The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a specialized endoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells that stores and releases calcium ions (\(Ca^{2+}\)) to control muscle contraction and relaxation. It is a network of tubules and sacs that surrounds each myofibril. In striated muscle, it is organized into longitudinal tubules and terminal cisternae that form junctions with the transverse tubules, which are invaginations of the cell membrane
