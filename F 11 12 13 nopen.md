## Topic 1: Overview of the Circulatory System and Transport Functions

### Overview

The circulatory system serves as the body's primary infrastructure for internal transport, consisting of the heart and blood vessels that form a closed loop spanning an estimated 160,000 kilometers in total length. This system interfaces with multiple organ systems including the respiratory, digestive, and urinary systems to facilitate the uptake and release of various substances essential for cellular function. Blood, which comprises seven to eight percent of body weight, circulates continuously through two serially connected circuits: the pulmonary circulation (handling gas exchange) and the systemic circulation (delivering nutrients and oxygen to tissues while removing waste products). The heart functions as a spontaneously contracting hollow muscle that drives blood flow, while the hierarchical organization of blood vessels—from large arteries to microscopic capillaries and back through veins—enables both bulk transport and precise local exchange with tissues.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 1.1: Circulatory System as Transport Infrastructure

The circulatory system represents the main infrastructure for transport within the body, connecting with the external environment through multiple pathways. These connections allow the uptake and release of different substances necessary for homeostasis. The system interfaces with the respiratory system for oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide release, with the digestive system for nutrient absorption, and with the urinary system for waste elimination. This integration enables the circulatory system to maintain the internal chemical environment required by cells throughout the body.

**Key details:**

- Acts as the primary transport network connecting all body systems
- Provides interface with external environment through multiple organ systems
- Enables bidirectional exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste products

**Slide reference:** Slide 3 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 1.2: Composition and Components of the Circulatory System

The circulatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels, with blood vessels having a total estimated length of 160,000 kilometers, equivalent to four trips around the Earth's equator. Blood flow depends on the heart, which is a hollow muscle capable of spontaneous contraction. This system is responsible for transporting substances dissolved in blood between different parts of the body. The extensive length of blood vessels ensures that capillaries can reach virtually every cell in the body, maintaining short diffusion distances for efficient exchange.

**Key details:**

- Heart and blood vessels form the structural components
- Total blood vessel length: approximately 160,000 km (16,000 mil)
- Heart contracts spontaneously without external neural stimulation required

**Slide reference:** Slide 4 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 1.3: Blood Composition and Volume

Blood fills the blood vessels and heart, comprising seven to eight percent of body weight, which translates to approximately five liters in a seventy-kilogram person. Blood consists of plasma (fifty-five percent) and cells (forty-five percent), primarily red blood cells with smaller numbers of other blood cell types. Unlike other tissues, blood lacks an extracellular matrix, with plasma serving as the liquid tissue fluid component. Plasma contains dissolved substances including blood gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide), plasma proteins, nutrients such as glucose and amino acids, waste products, ions, hormones, and lipoprotein particles that transport fats.

**Key details:**

- Blood volume: 7-8% of body weight (~5 liters in 70 kg person)
- Plasma (55%): water with dissolved substances (ions, proteins, nutrients, hormones, gases)
- Cells (45%): primarily red blood cells (erythrocytes), plus other blood cell types
- No extracellular matrix present in blood tissue
- Plasma proteins, glucose, amino acids, waste products, and lipoprotein particles circulate in plasma

**Slide reference:** Slide 5 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 1.4: Schematic Organization of Circulation into Two Circuits

The circulatory system's blood vessels are organized into two serially connected circuits: the pulmonary circulation (small circuit) and the systemic circulation (large circuit). Blood flow in each circuit always proceeds in the direction from artery to vein, with the driving force being the blood pressure difference between arteries and veins. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart, capillaries are vessels where exchange with tissue occurs, and veins are vessels that return blood to the heart. This serial arrangement ensures that all blood pumped through the systemic circulation must first pass through the pulmonary circulation for oxygenation.

**Key details:**

- Two serially connected circuits: pulmonary and systemic
- Arteries carry blood from heart; veins return blood to heart
- Capillaries are exchange sites with tissue
- Blood pressure gradient between artery and vein drives flow
- Right and left heart chambers shown schematically

**Slide reference:** Slide 6 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 1.5: Vascular Architecture in Body Tissues

In any tissue, a larger artery reaching the tissue branches into smaller arteries, which subsequently branch into arterioles that lead to capillaries where exchange with the tissue occurs. From capillaries, blood flows through venules and then into veins that return blood to the heart. This branching pattern creates a tree-like structure that progressively increases the total cross-sectional area of vessels while decreasing individual vessel diameter. The organization ensures that all tissue regions receive arterial blood supply and have venous drainage, with capillaries positioned to minimize diffusion distances to cells.

**Key details:**

- Hierarchical branching: artery → smaller arteries → arterioles → capillaries → venules → veins
- Capillaries are the site of substance exchange with tissue
- Pattern repeats in all vascularized tissues throughout the body

**Slide reference:** Slide 7 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 1.6: Size Overview of Systemic Circulation Vessels

The different types of blood vessels in the systemic circulation vary significantly in diameter and wall thickness, reflecting their specific functions. Arteries have a lumen diameter of four millimeters and wall thickness of one millimeter (aorta being larger at twenty-five millimeters diameter), arterioles have a thirty-micrometer diameter with six-micrometer wall thickness, capillaries have an eight-micrometer diameter with only half-micrometer wall thickness, venules have twenty-micrometer diameter with one-micrometer wall, and veins have five-millimeter diameter with half-millimeter wall (vena cava being thirty millimeters). These dimensions demonstrate that capillaries have the thinnest walls to facilitate exchange, while arteries have thick walls to withstand high pressure.

**Key details:**

- Aorta: 25 mm lumen diameter
- Artery: 4 mm lumen, 1 mm wall thickness
- Arteriole: 30 μm lumen, 6 μm wall thickness
- Capillary: 8 μm lumen, 0.5 μm wall thickness
- Venule: 20 μm lumen, 1 μm wall thickness
- Vein: 5 mm lumen, 0.5 mm wall thickness
- Vena cava: 30 mm lumen diameter

**Slide reference:** Slide 8 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 1.7: General Blood Vessel Wall Structure

Blood vessel walls have a general three-layered structure consisting of the tunica interna (innermost layer with endothelium and basal membrane), tunica media (middle layer with smooth muscle and interspersed elastic fibers), and tunica externa or adventitia (outer layer of connective tissue). This trilaminar organization is modified in different vessel types according to their specific functions. The endothelium forms a continuous cellular lining that contacts blood, the smooth muscle layer allows for vasoconstriction and vasodilation, and the connective tissue outer layer provides structural support and anchors vessels to surrounding tissue.

**Key details:**

- Tunica interna: endothelium with basal membrane (innermost layer)
- Tunica media: smooth muscle with elastic fiber interspersions (middle layer)
- Tunica externa (adventitia): connective tissue (outer layer)
- Three-layer pattern modified according to vessel type and function

**Slide reference:** Slide 9 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 1.8: Structural Variation Among Blood Vessel Types

The architecture of different blood vessels reflects their distinct functions in circulation. Arteries have thick walls with abundant smooth muscle to withstand high pressure, arterioles are resistance vessels with small diameter that can be strongly regulated by smooth muscle contraction to alter blood flow, capillaries have thin walls to maximize exchange with surrounding tissue, and venules and veins are capacitance vessels where blood experiences low pressure. The endothelium and basal membrane are present in all vessel types, but the amount of smooth muscle and connective tissue varies dramatically. Arterioles in particular have relatively thick muscular walls for their size, allowing them to function as the primary regulators of blood flow distribution.

**Key details:**

- Arteries: thick walls with much smooth muscle to resist high pressure
- Arterioles: resistance vessels with small diameter; strongly regulatable by smooth muscle
- Capillaries: thin walls to maximize exchange with surrounding tissue
- Venules and veins: capacitance vessels with low blood pressure
- All contain endothelium and basal membrane
- Smooth muscle content varies by vessel type

**Slide reference:** Slide 10 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 1.9: Blood Gas Transport Through Circulation

The circulatory system transports oxygen and carbon dioxide between tissues and lungs through its two circuits. In the systemic circulation, oxygen diffuses from capillaries into tissue cells while carbon dioxide diffuses from cells into capillaries. This oxygen-depleted, carbon dioxide-enriched blood returns to the right heart and is pumped through the pulmonary circulation to the lungs. In lung alveoli, carbon dioxide diffuses out of capillaries while oxygen diffuses in, reoxygenating the blood. The oxygenated blood returns to the left heart for distribution back to systemic tissues. This continuous cycling ensures that all body cells receive oxygen for aerobic metabolism while carbon dioxide waste is eliminated.

**Key details:**

- Systemic circulation: O₂ delivered to cells, CO₂ picked up from cells
- Pulmonary circulation: CO₂ released to alveoli, O₂ picked up from alveoli
- Right heart pumps deoxygenated blood to lungs
- Left heart pumps oxygenated blood to body tissues
- Gas exchange occurs in capillaries through diffusion

**Slide reference:** Slide 11 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 1.10: Blood Flow Pattern Through Circulatory System

Blood flows through the circulatory system following a specific pathway: from the left heart chamber through the aorta (first artery), to arteries serving the head, arms, trunk, and legs, through tissue capillaries where exchange occurs, into veins, and finally to the superior and inferior vena cava that return blood to the right heart chamber. From the right heart, blood flows through pulmonary arteries to lung capillaries for gas exchange, then through pulmonary veins back to the left heart chamber. This circuit repeats continuously, with the entire blood volume circulating through both circuits at the same rate. The diagram distinguishes oxygen-rich blood (typically shown in red) from oxygen-poor blood (typically shown in blue).

**Key details:**

- Left heart → aorta → systemic arteries → tissue capillaries → veins → vena cava → right heart
- Right heart → pulmonary arteries → lung capillaries → pulmonary veins → left heart
- Oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood distinguished
- Continuous循环 through both circuits

**Slide reference:** Slide 12 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 1.11: Parallel Connection of Vessels in Each Circuit

The blood vessels in each circuit are connected in parallel, which is particularly important for the systemic circulation. Parallel connection ensures that all tissues receive oxygen-rich blood rather than progressively oxygen-depleted blood. This design also allows for redistribution of blood flow between different parts of the body through changes in flow resistance in different systemic circulation regions. For example, during exercise, blood flow can be redirected from the digestive system to skeletal muscles by altering the constriction of arterioles in these different regions. The parallel arrangement means that while total cardiac output is fixed at any moment, the distribution of that output among organs can be dynamically adjusted.

**Key details:**

- Vessels in each circuit are parallel-connected
- Parallel connection ensures all tissues receive oxygen-rich blood
- Allows redistribution of blood flow between body regions
- Redistribution occurs through altered flow resistance (arteriole constriction/dilation)
- Particularly important in systemic circulation

**Slide reference:** Slide 13 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 1.12: Redistribution of Blood Flow in Systemic Circulation

Blood flow redistribution in the systemic circulation varies dramatically between rest and physical exertion. During rest, significant blood flow goes to the digestive organs, while during physical exercise, sympathetic nervous stimulation primarily causes arterioles in the intestines to constrict (reducing flow) while arterioles in skeletal muscles dilate (increasing flow). The degree of contraction in arterioles determines the current flow distribution of blood to different body parts. Heart rate also increases during exercise, pumping a larger volume per unit time through the system. This redistribution mechanism allows the body to match blood supply to metabolic demand dynamically.

**Key details:**

- Rest: significant flow to digestive organs
- Exercise: reduced digestive flow, increased skeletal muscle flow
- Sympathetic stimulation causes arteriole constriction in intestines, dilation in muscles
- Arteriole contraction degree determines blood distribution
- Heart rate increases during exercise, increasing total pumped volume per time

**Slide reference:** Slide 14 (Lecture 11)

## Topic 2: Portal Systems—Serial Capillary Beds

### Overview

Portal systems represent specialized vascular arrangements where two capillary beds are connected in series without the blood passing through the heart between them. Under normal circumstances, blood passes through the heart before reaching a new capillary system, but in portal systems, blood flows from one capillary bed directly into another through a connecting vessel. In humans, portal systems exist in only a few specific locations: between the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, within the kidneys (glomerular-peritubular capillary connection), and between the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland. These arrangements serve critical physiological functions, including nutrient processing in the liver, urine formation in kidneys, and endocrine regulation through hypothalamic-pituitary communication.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 2.1: Definition and Examples of Portal Systems

A portal system occurs when two capillary systems follow one another without blood passing through the heart in between. The normal sequence of heart → artery → capillary → vein → heart is modified to heart → artery → capillary → larger vessel → capillary → vein → heart. In the human body, portal systems are found in only a few specific cases: the pathway from the gastrointestinal tract to the liver, within the kidneys, and between the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. These specialized arrangements allow for direct processing or regulation of blood contents before that blood returns to general circulation.

**Key details:**

- Portal system: two capillary beds in series without intervening heart passage
- Normal: heart → artery → capillary → vein → heart
- Portal: heart → artery → capillary → vessel → capillary → vein → heart
- Human portal systems: GI tract-liver, kidney, hypothalamus-pituitary

**Slide reference:** Slide 15 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 2.2: Nutrient Transport from Intestine Through Circulation

Nutrients absorbed from the small intestine enter capillaries in the intestinal wall, then follow blood flow through the heart and pulmonary circulation before returning to the systemic circulation. The parallel connection of the systemic circulation allows simultaneous distribution of nutrients to different body parts. When nutrients reach tissue capillaries, they can leave the bloodstream and reach cells that require them. This process ensures that absorbed nutrients, such as glucose and amino acids, are distributed throughout the body to meet cellular metabolic needs. The pathway demonstrates how the circulatory system coordinates nutrient delivery following intestinal absorption.

**Key details:**

- Nutrients (e.g., glucose, amino acids) absorbed from small intestine into intestinal wall capillaries
- Blood flows through heart and pulmonary circulation
- Returns to systemic circulation for distribution
- Parallel connection enables simultaneous delivery to all tissues
- Nutrients exit capillaries to reach tissue cells

**Slide reference:** Slide 16 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 2.3: The Hepatic Portal System Between Intestine and Liver

The portal system between the intestine and liver involves capillaries in the intestinal walls connected via the portal vein (vena portae hepatis) directly to capillaries in the liver, without intervening heart passage. Nutrients and toxic substances absorbed from the small intestine first enter intestinal capillaries, then flow directly to liver capillaries. In the liver, toxic substances are taken up from capillaries and detoxified by hepatocytes, while nutrients continue in the circulation. This arrangement ensures that potentially harmful substances absorbed from the digestive tract are processed by the liver before entering general circulation, providing a first-pass detoxification mechanism. The liver thus gets "first access" to absorbed nutrients and must neutralize absorbed toxins.

**Key details:**

- Intestinal wall capillaries → portal vein (v. portae hepatis) → liver capillaries
- Nutrients and toxic substances both absorbed from small intestine
- Liver capillaries receive blood directly from intestinal capillaries
- Toxic substances detoxified by liver cells (hepatocytes)
- Liver gets "first access" (first "tjing") to nutrients
- Provides first-pass detoxification before general circulation

**Slide reference:** Slide 17 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 2.4: Complete Pathway of Nutrients Through Circulation

The complete pathway of nutrients from intestinal absorption through the circulatory system involves several steps. First, nutrients and toxic substances are absorbed from the small intestine into capillaries. Second, toxic substances are detoxified in the liver while nutrients continue in the bloodstream. Third, nutrients proceed through the pulmonary circulation. Fourth and finally, nutrients are taken up by cells in body tissues. The portal vein carries both nutrients and toxins directly to the liver, ensuring detoxification occurs before these substances reach other organs. This sequence protects the body from ingested toxins while ensuring efficient nutrient distribution.

**Key details:**

- Step 1: Absorption from small intestine (nutrients and toxins)
- Step 2: Detoxification of toxins in liver; nutrients continue
- Step 3: Passage through pulmonary circulation
- Step 4: Nutrient uptake by tissue cells
- Portal vein links intestinal and hepatic capillary beds

**Slide reference:** Slide 18 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 2.5: Oxygen Supply to the Liver

The liver requires oxygen like all other tissues, but the portal vein contains oxygen-poor blood since it comes from the intestines after gas exchange has occurred in intestinal tissues. To meet the liver's oxygen requirements, the hepatic artery (a. hepatica) supplies the liver with oxygen-rich blood from the systemic circulation. This dual blood supply to the liver—portal vein for nutrient processing and hepatic artery for oxygenation—ensures that hepatocytes have both the substrates to process and the oxygen needed for their high metabolic activity. The hepatic artery branches from the systemic circulation before the portal system connection.

**Key details:**

- Portal vein contains oxygen-poor blood (after intestinal tissue extraction)
- Hepatic artery (a. hepatica) supplies oxygen-rich blood to liver
- Dual liver blood supply: portal vein (nutrients/processing) + hepatic artery (oxygenation)
- Liver cells need oxygen for their metabolic functions
- Hepatic artery branches from systemic arterial system

**Slide reference:** Slide 19 (Lecture 11)

## Topic 3: Kidney Portal System and Waste Elimination

### Overview

The kidney contains a specialized portal system that serves the critical function of filtering blood to form urine and eliminate waste products. Each nephron, the kidney's functional unit, is associated with its own portal system consisting of glomerular capillaries (where ultrafiltration occurs) connected in series to peritubular capillaries (where selective reabsorption occurs). This arrangement allows approximately twenty percent of the blood volume at rest to be filtered continuously, with water, nutrients, ions, and waste products initially filtered into Bowman's space, followed by selective reabsorption of valuable substances back into the blood via peritubular capillaries. The kidney's portal system thus enables precise regulation of blood composition and waste elimination while conserving essential nutrients and water.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 3.1: Transport of Waste Products to Kidneys

Waste products leave cells in the body and enter nearby tissue capillaries, then follow blood flow through the heart and pulmonary circulation before returning to the systemic circulation. The portion of systemic circulation blood that goes to the kidneys (greater than twenty percent under resting conditions) is filtered, allowing waste products to be separated from blood and become part of urine. This high renal blood flow ensures that waste products are continuously removed from circulation. The kidneys receive one of the highest blood flow rates per tissue mass of any organ, reflecting their critical role in maintaining blood composition.

**Key details:**

- Waste products enter tissue capillaries from cells
- Blood flows through heart and pulmonary circulation
- > 20% of systemic circulation blood goes to kidneys at rest
    
- Kidney filtration separates waste from blood
- Waste becomes component of urine

**Slide reference:** Slide 20 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 3.2: Functional Organization of the Urinary System

The urinary system's functional organization centers on the nephron, which contains a portal system of blood vessels. The process where initial (primary) urine forms occurs from one capillary system called the glomerular capillaries. The process where parts of the urine are reabsorbed into blood occurs at a second capillary system called the peritubular capillaries. Each nephron in the kidney is coupled to its own portal system, with blood flowing from glomerular capillaries through an efferent arteriole to peritubular capillaries before exiting via venous drainage. This serial arrangement allows for both filtration and selective reabsorption in a coordinated manner.

**Key details:**

- Nephron contains a portal system
- Capillary system #1: glomerular capillaries (filtration site)
- Capillary system #2: peritubular capillaries (reabsorption site)
- Each nephron has its own portal system
- Primary urine formed from glomerular filtration
- Substances reabsorbed at peritubular capillaries

**Slide reference:** Slide 21 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 3.3: Nephron Structure and Blood Flow Connections

The nephron structure includes an afferent arteriole bringing blood to the glomerular capillary tuft, which is surrounded by Bowman's capsule (Bowman's space/room). Blood exits glomerular capillaries through an efferent arteriole, which then branches into peritubular capillaries that surround the tubule system where urine modification occurs. The final urine product drains to the urinary bladder. This arrangement creates a portal system where blood is filtered at high pressure in glomerular capillaries, then flows at lower pressure through peritubular capillaries for selective reabsorption. The terms afferent (bringing toward) and efferent (carrying away) describe arteriole direction relative to the glomerulus.

**Key details:**

- Afferent arteriole → glomerular capillary → efferent arteriole → peritubular capillary
- Bowman's space/capsule surrounds glomerular capillaries
- Tubule system surrounded by peritubular capillaries
- Final urine drains to urinary bladder
- Portal system: two capillary beds in series

**Slide reference:** Slide 21 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 3.4: Flow Percentages Through the Nephron

The nephron's flow dynamics show that one hundred percent of incoming arterial blood enters through the afferent arteriole to the glomerular capillaries. Approximately twenty percent of the plasma volume is filtered into Bowman's space, while eighty percent continues through the efferent arteriole to peritubular capillaries. Of the filtered twenty percent, approximately 99.8 percent is reabsorbed back into blood at the peritubular capillaries, with only 0.2 percent excreted as final urine. The eighty percent that bypassed filtration plus the 19.8 percent reabsorbed equals 99.8 percent total venous outflow. This demonstrates that the kidneys filter large volumes but reabsorb most of the filtrate, allowing precise waste removal while conserving water and nutrients.

**Key details:**

- 100% arterial inflow via afferent arteriole
- 20% filtered into Bowman's space
- 80% bypasses filtration, continues to peritubular capillaries
- 99.8% of filtered volume reabsorbed
- 0.2% excreted as urine
- 99.8% total venous outflow (80% + 19.8%)

**Slide reference:** Slide 22 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 3.5: Water Flow Through the Nephron

Water flow through the nephron follows the same pattern as total filtrate, with twenty percent of plasma water filtered into Bowman's space at the glomerular capillaries. The remaining eighty percent continues through the efferent arteriole to peritubular capillaries. Of the filtered water, 99.8 percent is reabsorbed from the tubule system back into blood at the peritubular capillaries, while only 0.2 percent is excreted as urine. This high reabsorption rate prevents excessive water loss while still allowing waste elimination. The kidneys thus balance the competing needs of waste removal and water conservation through selective reabsorption.

**Key details:**

- 20% of plasma water filtered at glomerulus
- 80% bypasses filtration
- 99.8% of filtered water reabsorbed at peritubular capillaries
- 0.2% excreted in final urine
- High reabsorption rate conserves water while eliminating waste

**Slide reference:** Slide 23 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 3.6: Selective Filtration and Reabsorption of Blood Components

Different blood components are handled differently by the nephron's filtration and reabsorption processes. Small molecules like glucose, amino acids, ions, and waste products are freely filtered into Bowman's space along with water. However, blood cells and large plasma proteins are too large to be filtered and remain in the blood, passing through the efferent arteriole to peritubular capillaries. Valuable nutrients like glucose and amino acids are completely reabsorbed at the tubules, while waste products remain in the tubular fluid. Ions and water are partially reabsorbed according to the body's needs. This selective process ensures that essential nutrients are retained while waste is eliminated.

**Key details:**

- Blood cells: not filtered, too large
- Plasma proteins: not filtered, too large
- Glucose: filtered, then completely reabsorbed
- Amino acids: filtered, then completely reabsorbed
- Ions: filtered, then partially reabsorbed
- Waste products: filtered, minimal or no reabsorption
- Water: filtered, then mostly reabsorbed (99.8%)

**Slide reference:** Slide 24 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 3.7: Complete Kidney Flow Including Filtration and Reabsorption

A more complete picture of kidney flow shows the afferent arteriole bringing blood to glomerular capillaries where filtration occurs. The filtrate containing water, nutrients, ions, waste products, and toxins enters Bowman's space and flows through the tubule system. At the peritubular capillaries surrounding the tubules, reabsorption occurs, where water, nutrients, and ions return to the blood while waste products and toxins remain in the tubular fluid. Blood cells and plasma proteins never leave the vascular system, continuing from glomerular to peritubular capillaries. This coordinated filtration and reabsorption process purifies blood while conserving essential substances.

**Key details:**

- Afferent arteriole → glomerular capillary (filtration)
- Filtrate components: water, nutrients, ions, waste, toxins
- Blood cells and plasma proteins not filtered
- Peritubular capillaries (reabsorption site)
- Water, nutrients, ions reabsorbed
- Waste and toxins remain in tubular fluid for excretion

**Slide reference:** Slide 25 (Lecture 11)

## Topic 4: Hypothalamic-Pituitary Portal System

### Overview

The hypothalamic-pituitary portal system represents a third example of serially connected capillary beds in humans, serving endocrine regulatory functions. The pituitary gland (hypophysis), a pea-sized endocrine gland connected to the brain, secretes eight different protein hormones, several of which regulate hormone secretion from other endocrine glands throughout the body. The anterior pituitary's hormone secretion is controlled by hypothalamic hormones (neurohormones) released from neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus into capillaries in the pituitary stalk. These hormones travel directly through the hypothalamic-pituitary portal system to reach anterior pituitary cells, where they stimulate or inhibit specific hormone release without first entering general circulation. This direct communication pathway allows rapid and specific control of pituitary hormone secretion in response to signals from the central nervous system.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 4.1: Structure and Function of the Pituitary Gland

The pituitary gland (hypophysis) is an endocrine gland approximately the size of a pea located in connection with the brain. From the pituitary, a total of eight different protein hormones are secreted into circulation. Several of these pituitary hormones regulate the secretion of hormones from other endocrine glands in the body, establishing the pituitary as a master endocrine regulator. The pituitary consists of an anterior lobe (adenohypophysis) and posterior lobe (neurohypophysis), with different functional properties. The anterior pituitary's secretory activity is controlled by hypothalamic neurohormones that reach it through the portal system.

**Key details:**

- Pea-sized endocrine gland connected to brain
- Secretes eight different protein hormones
- Several hormones regulate other endocrine glands
- Acts as master endocrine regulator
- Divided into anterior and posterior lobes

**Slide reference:** Slide 26 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 4.2: Hypothalamic Control of Anterior Pituitary Hormone Secretion

Hypothalamic hormones secreted from the hypothalamus can influence the secretion of hormones from the adenohypophysis (anterior pituitary). These hypothalamic neurohormones can either stimulate or inhibit the secretion of specific hormones from the anterior pituitary. The hypothalamus receives signals from other parts of the central nervous system, integrating neural information to regulate endocrine function. The anterior pituitary hormones then exert effects on their target cells throughout the body. This hierarchical control system allows the nervous system to regulate endocrine function through the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.

**Key details:**

- Hypothalamic hormones (neurohormones) influence anterior pituitary secretion
- Can stimulate or inhibit specific hormone release
- Hypothalamus receives signals from other CNS regions
- Anterior pituitary hormones affect target cells body-wide
- Integrates neural and endocrine signaling

**Slide reference:** Slide 27 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 4.3: Pathway of Hypothalamic-Pituitary Portal System

The hypothalamic-dependent regulation of the adenohypophysis follows a specific pathway. First, hypothalamic hormones are secreted into capillaries in the pituitary stalk from neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus. Second, the neurohormone is transported directly to the anterior pituitary through the portal system connecting hypothalamus and anterior pituitary. Third, the neurohormone stimulates secretion of a specific hormone from anterior pituitary cells. Fourth, the released anterior pituitary hormone spreads to the rest of the body via general circulation. This portal system arrangement allows hypothalamic hormones to reach the anterior pituitary at high concentrations without being diluted in general circulation first.

**Key details:**

- Step 1: Hypothalamic hormone secretion into pituitary stalk capillaries
- Step 2: Direct transport to anterior pituitary via portal system
- Step 3: Stimulation of specific hormone secretion from anterior pituitary
- Step 4: Anterior pituitary hormone distributed to body via circulation
- Portal system prevents dilution of hypothalamic hormones

**Slide reference:** Slide 28 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 4.4: Growth Hormone Regulation Example

The regulation of growth hormone (GH) secretion illustrates hypothalamic-pituitary control. When specific stimuli are received by the hypothalamus from other parts of the CNS, the hypothalamic hormone GH-RH (Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone) is secreted from hypothalamic cells. GH-RH travels directly to the anterior pituitary through the portal system connecting hypothalamus and anterior pituitary. GH-RH then stimulates exocytosis of GH from specific cells in the anterior pituitary. Finally, GH stimulates, among other effects, the secretion of IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor-1) from liver cells, which mediates many of growth hormone's growth-promoting effects throughout the body.

**Key details:**

- Stimulus → hypothalamus secretes GH-RH (Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone)
- GH-RH travels via portal system to anterior pituitary
- GH-RH stimulates GH secretion from anterior pituitary cells
- GH stimulates IGF-1 secretion from liver cells
- IGF-1 mediates growth effects on target cells

## Topic 5: Heart Anatomy and Structure

### Overview

The heart is a hollow muscular organ approximately the size of a person's closed fist, with a dry weight of about three hundred grams, positioned between the lungs in the thoracic cavity. The heart wall consists primarily of cardiac muscle tissue (myocardium) capable of spontaneous contraction at a baseline frequency of approximately one hundred beats per minute, though this rate is modulated by the autonomic nervous system. The heart is divided into right and left halves, each containing an atrium (receiving chamber) and a ventricle (pumping chamber), with heart valves ensuring unidirectional blood flow through the chambers. The heart is enclosed by the pericardium (heart sac), which prevents overdistension, and at rest, each half of the heart pumps approximately five liters of blood per minute through its respective circuit.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 5.1: Introduction to Heart Structure and Function

The heart's size corresponds approximately to the size of a person's clenched fist, with a dry weight of approximately three hundred grams. The heart is a hollow muscle whose walls consist of cardiac muscle tissue that pumps blood to the circulatory system's arteries. The heart has an independent ability to initiate contractions of cardiac musculature with an approximate frequency of one hundred beats per minute, though the autonomic nervous system can modify this frequency. At rest, approximately five liters of blood are pumped out from each heart half per minute. This spontaneous contractile ability distinguishes cardiac muscle from skeletal muscle, which requires motor neuron stimulation.

**Key details:**

- Size: approximately person's closed fist
- Dry weight: ~300 grams
- Hollow muscle with cardiac muscle walls
- Independent spontaneous contraction capability: ~100 beats/min baseline
- Autonomic nervous system modulates contraction rate
- ~5 liters/min pumped from each heart half at rest

**Slide reference:** Slide 30 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 5.2: Heart Position and Protection

The heart is positioned between the lungs in the thoracic cavity (chest cavity). Because the left half of the heart is more developed (more muscular), the heart lies somewhat to the left of the body's midline. The surrounding rib cage (thoracic cage) protects the heart from mechanical injury. The sternum (breastbone), ribs (os costae), and diaphragm (mellangärdesmuskeln/m. diaphragma) form the protective bony and muscular framework around the heart. This central thoracic position places the heart close to major vessels and provides optimal mechanical protection.

**Key details:**

- Located between lungs in thoracic cavity
- Positioned slightly left of midline (due to more developed left heart)
- Protected by rib cage (thoracic cage)
- Sternum, ribs (os costae), and diaphragm (m. diaphragma) provide protection
- Central position optimal for vessel connections

**Slide reference:** Slide 31 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 5.3: The Pericardium (Heart Sac)

The heart is enclosed by the heart sac called the pericardium, which prevents overdistension (overstretching) of the heart. The pericardium consists of two layers: a visceral layer (epicardium) that directly contacts the heart surface and a parietal layer that forms the outer sac. Between these layers is the pericardial cavity containing a small amount of lubricating fluid. The parietal layer contains tough connective tissue that resists stretching, mechanically limiting how much the heart can expand. The visceral layer includes mesothelium (simple squamous epithelium) and adipose (fat) cells. Abnormal fluid accumulation in the pericardial cavity is called cardiac tamponade and can impair heart function.

**Key details:**

- Pericardium encloses heart and prevents overdistension
- Visceral layer (epicardium): directly on heart surface
- Parietal layer: outer sac with tough connective tissue
- Pericardial cavity: space between layers
- Cardiac tamponade: abnormal fluid accumulation in pericardial cavity
- Mesothelium and adipose cells in epicardium

#### Subtopic 5.4: Heart Chamber Division and Function

The heart is divided into a right half and a left half, with each half further divided into an atrium (förmak) and a ventricle (kammare). The atrium receives blood returning to the heart, while the ventricle pumps blood out of the heart. Since blood circulation is a closed system where the heart's parts and blood vessels are serially connected, heart valves are necessary to prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction within each heart half. The four chambers work in a coordinated manner, with the two atria contracting together followed by contraction of both ventricles. This separation into right and left sides keeps oxygenated and deoxygenated blood separate.

**Key details:**

- Right and left heart halves
- Each half contains atrium (receiving chamber) and ventricle (pumping chamber)
- Atrium receives blood; ventricle pumps blood out
- Closed system requires valves to prevent backflow
- Four chambers: right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, left ventricle
- Right and left sides keep oxygenated and deoxygenated blood separated

**Slide reference:** Slide 33 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 5.5: Heart Valves and Flow Direction

Heart valves ensure correct flow direction within the heart chambers. The valves are named as follows: tricuspid valve (trikuspidalklaffen) between right atrium and right ventricle, pulmonary valve (pulmonalisklaffen) between right ventricle and pulmonary trunk, bicuspid/mitral valve (bikuspidalklaffen/mitralisklaffen) between left atrium and left ventricle, and aortic valve (aortaklaffen) between left ventricle and aorta. The valves are categorized as either AV valves/sail valves (atrioventricular valves between atria and ventricles) or semilunar valves/pocket valves (between ventricles and arteries). These valves open and close passively based on pressure differences between chambers.

**Key details:**

- Tricuspid valve: right atrium ↔ right ventricle
- Pulmonary valve: right ventricle ↔ pulmonary trunk
- Bicuspid/mitral valve: left atrium ↔ left ventricle
- Aortic valve: left ventricle ↔ aorta
- AV valves/sail valves: between atria and ventricles
- Semilunar valves/pocket valves: between ventricles and arteries

**Slide reference:** Slide 34 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 5.6: Ventricular Filling During Diastole

During the diastole phase of the cardiac cycle, the AV valves are open, which allows blood that previously accumulated in each atrium to now fill the two ventricles with blood. This ventricular filling occurs primarily due to gravity and the pressure difference between atria and ventricles. During the later part of diastole, the musculature of the atria contracts to maximize ventricular filling, contributing approximately twenty-five percent of the total blood transferred from atria to ventricles. Diastole comprises two-thirds of the time in the cardiac cycle under resting conditions, allowing adequate time for ventricular filling.

**Key details:**

- Diastole: ventricular filling phase
- AV valves open during diastole
- Blood flows from atria to ventricles
- Filling driven primarily by gravity and pressure difference
- Late diastole: atrial contraction adds ~25% to ventricular filling
- Diastole = 2/3 of cardiac cycle time at rest

**Slide reference:** Slide 35 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 5.7: Ventricular Ejection During Systole

During the systole phase of the cardiac cycle, the ventricular musculature contracts and the semilunar valves open while the AV valves close. High-pressure blood is now pressed out from each ventricle to the two circuits (pulmonary and systemic). The musculature in the left ventricular wall is stronger and can therefore contract more forcefully; consequently, blood is pressed out into the systemic circulation with higher pressure compared to the pulmonary circulation. The semilunar valves prevent backflow from the arteries into the ventricles after contraction. Systole represents one-third of the cardiac cycle time at rest.

**Key details:**

- Systole: ventricular ejection phase
- Ventricular musculature contracts
- Semilunar valves open; AV valves close
- Blood ejected from ventricles to circuits
- Left ventricle stronger: higher pressure to systemic circulation
- Right ventricle: lower pressure to pulmonary circulation
- Systole = 1/3 of cardiac cycle time at rest

**Slide reference:** Slide 36 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 5.8: Blood Vessels Connected to Heart Chambers

Specific blood vessels connect to each heart chamber. The right atrium receives blood from two vena cava (superior and inferior) plus the coronary sinus draining the heart muscle itself. The right ventricle pumps blood into the pulmonary trunk (truncus pulmonalis), which divides into two pulmonary arteries leading to the lungs. The left atrium receives blood from four pulmonary veins (two from each lung). The left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta (kroppspulsådern), which branches into multiple larger arteries supplying the systemic circulation. This arrangement ensures proper routing of blood through both pulmonary and systemic circuits.

**Key details:**

- Right atrium: receives from 2 vena cava + coronary sinus
- Right ventricle: pumps to pulmonary trunk → 2 pulmonary arteries
- Left atrium: receives from 4 pulmonary veins
- Left ventricle: pumps to aorta → multiple systemic arteries
- Coronary sinus drains heart muscle blood to right atrium

**Slide reference:** Slide 37 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 5.9: Blood Vessels to and from Heart (Anterior and Posterior Views)

From anterior and posterior views, the major vessels entering and leaving the heart can be identified. The pulmonary trunk and pulmonary arteries carry blood from the right ventricle to the lungs. Four pulmonary veins return oxygenated blood from lungs to the left atrium. The aorta (kroppspulsådern) carries blood from the left ventricle to the systemic circulation. The vena cava (superior and inferior) return systemic venous blood to the right atrium. These vessels are visible on the heart's surface and their positions reflect the underlying chamber connections. Understanding these vessel positions is important for recognizing cardiac anatomy in clinical imaging.

**Key details:**

- Anterior view shows pulmonary trunk, aorta, vena cava
- Posterior view shows pulmonary veins, vena cava
- Pulmonary trunk/arteries: right ventricle → lungs
- Pulmonary veins (4): lungs → left atrium
- Aorta: left ventricle → systemic circulation
- Vena cava: systemic circulation → right atrium

**Slide reference:** Slide 38 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 5.10: Detailed Anatomy of Heart Chambers and Connected Vessels

The detailed anatomy shows the right atrium (atrium dexter/HF) receiving blood from the vena cava (v. cava superior and inferior). The right ventricle (ventriculus dexter/HK) pumps blood through the pulmonary trunk (truncus pulmonalis) to the pulmonary arteries (a. pulmonalis dexter and sinister). The left atrium (atrium sinister/VF) receives blood from the pulmonary veins (vv. pulmonales). The left ventricle (ventriculus sinister/VK) pumps blood into the aorta, specifically the initial segment called the ascending aorta, which branches into the anterior interventricular branch (ramus interventricularis anterior) on the heart surface. The Latin anatomical terms use "dexter" for right and "sinister" for left.

**Key details:**

- Right atrium (atrium dexter, HF): from vena cava
- Right ventricle (ventriculus dexter, HK): to truncus pulmonalis → pulmonary arteries
- Left atrium (atrium sinister, VF): from pulmonary veins
- Left ventricle (ventriculus sinister, VK): to aorta
- Ramus interventricularis anterior: coronary artery branch
- Latin terms: dexter (right), sinister (left)

**Slide reference:** Slide 39 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 5.11: Heart Valve Detailed Structure

The heart valves have specific structural features. The tricuspid valve (valva tricuspidalis) has three leaflets between right atrium and right ventricle. The bicuspid/mitral valve (valva bicuspidalis/valva mitralis) has two leaflets between left atrium and left ventricle. The pulmonary valve (valva trunci pulmonalis) and aortic valve (valva aortae) are semilunar valves with three cusps each. The AV valves are supported by papillary muscles, which are projections of ventricular muscle that connect to the valve leaflets via chordae tendinae (tendinous cords). These structures help hold the AV valves closed during high ventricular pressure in systole, preventing valve prolapse into the atria.

**Key details:**

- Tricuspid valve (valva tricuspidalis): 3 leaflets, right AV valve
- Bicuspid/mitral valve (valva bicuspidalis/mitralis): 2 leaflets, left AV valve
- Pulmonary valve (valva trunci pulmonalis): semilunar, right ventricular outflow
- Aortic valve (valva aortae): semilunar, left ventricular outflow
- Papillary muscles: ventricular muscle projections
- Chordae tendinae: tendinous cords anchoring AV valves to papillary muscles
- Prevent AV valve prolapse during systole

**Slide reference:** Slide 40 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 5.12: Superior View of Heart Valves

Viewing the heart valves from above (after removing the atria and great vessels) shows their spatial arrangement. The tricuspid valve, pulmonary valve, aortic valve, and bicuspid/mitral valve can be seen in their anatomical positions. This superior view demonstrates that all four valves lie roughly in the same horizontal plane, with the AV valves (tricuspid and bicuspid) having different numbers of leaflets as their names suggest. The semilunar valves (pulmonary and aortic) have three cusps each arranged in a characteristic pattern. This view is useful for understanding valve relationships and surgical approaches.

**Key details:**

- Superior (from above) view after removing atria and vessels
- Shows spatial relationships between four valves
- Tricuspid, pulmonary, aortic, and bicuspid/mitral valves visible
- All valves lie approximately in same plane
- Demonstrates leaflet/cusp arrangements

## Topic 6: The Cardiac Cycle—Diastole and Systole

### Overview

The cardiac cycle consists of alternating periods of ventricular relaxation (diastole) and contraction (systole), with each complete cycle lasting less than one second at normal resting heart rate. During diastole, the ventricles fill with blood as AV valves open and blood flows from atria to ventricles, driven initially by gravity and pressure differences, then augmented by atrial contraction in late diastole. During systole, ventricular muscle contracts forcefully, closing AV valves and opening semilunar valves to eject blood into the pulmonary and systemic circulations. The opening and closing of heart valves is governed entirely by pressure differences between chambers, with valves opening when downstream pressure is lower and closing when upstream pressure drops. This pressure-driven mechanism ensures unidirectional blood flow without requiring active valve control.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 6.1: Sequential Order of Heart Valves in Blood Flow

The blood flow path through the heart follows a specific sequence involving all four valves. In the right heart: blood flows through the tricuspid valve (trikuspildalisklaffen) from right atrium to right ventricle, then through the pulmonary valve (pulmonalisklaffen) from right ventricle to pulmonary trunk. In the left heart: blood flows through the bicuspid valve (bikuspildalisklaffen) from left atrium to left ventricle, then through the aortic valve (aortaklaffen) from left ventricle to aorta. The proper sequential opening and closing of these valves ensures that blood flows in only one direction through the heart, preventing regurgitation that would reduce pumping efficiency.

**Key details:**

- Right heart: tricuspid valve → pulmonary valve
- Left heart: bicuspid/mitral valve → aortic valve
- Sequential valve action ensures unidirectional flow
- Prevents blood regurgitation
- Both hearts work simultaneously in parallel

**Slide reference:** Slide 42 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 6.2: Heart Contraction Cycle Overview

The heart's contraction cycle alternates between diastole and systole. During diastole, blood fills each ventricle when the valves between atria and ventricles are open, with flow from atrium to ventricle driven primarily by gravitational force initially. During systole, blood leaves each ventricle for the arteries when the valves between ventricles and arteries are open, with flow from ventricle to artery driven by

Let me continue from where I left off with the cardiac cycle section.

contraction of ventricular musculature. The cycle repeats continuously, with diastole occupying approximately two-thirds and systole one-third of the cycle duration at resting heart rates.

**Key details:**

- Diastole: ventricular filling, AV valves open
- Systole: ventricular ejection, semilunar valves open
- Diastole: flow driven primarily by gravity
- Systole: flow driven by ventricular muscle contraction
- Continuous alternation between phases

**Slide reference:** Slide 43 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 6.3: Timing of Valve Opening During Cardiac Cycle

The timing of heart valve opening is strictly coordinated with the cardiac cycle phases. During diastole (ventricular filling), the AV valves between atria and ventricles are open, allowing blood to flow from atria into ventricles. During systole (ventricular ejection), the semilunar valves between ventricles and arteries are open, allowing blood to be ejected from ventricles into the arteries. The AV valves are closed during systole to prevent backflow into atria, and the semilunar valves are closed during diastole to prevent backflow from arteries into ventricles. This reciprocal pattern of valve opening and closing is entirely passive, driven by pressure differences.

**Key details:**

- Diastole: AV valves open (atrium-ventricle connection)
- Systole: semilunar valves open (ventricle-artery connection)
- AV valves closed during systole
- Semilunar valves closed during diastole
- Reciprocal opening/closing pattern

**Slide reference:** Slide 44 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 6.4: Pressure-Driven Regulation of Valve Opening

The degree of opening of heart valves is regulated entirely by pressure differences between chambers. When pressure is low in the ventricle, the AV valve is open and the semilunar valve is closed, allowing the ventricle to fill with blood from the atrium. When pressure is high in the ventricle, the AV valve is closed and the semilunar valve is open, allowing blood to be pressed out into the artery from the ventricle while preventing backflow into the atrium. Valves open when the pressure on the inflow side exceeds the pressure on the outflow side, and close when this relationship reverses. This passive mechanism requires no active control or energy expenditure by the valves themselves.

**Key details:**

- Low ventricular pressure: AV valve open, semilunar valve closed
- High ventricular pressure: AV valve closed, semilunar valve open
- Valves respond passively to pressure gradients
- Ventricular filling occurs at low pressure
- Ventricular ejection occurs at high pressure
- No active valve control required

**Slide reference:** Slide 45 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 6.5: Cardiac Cycle Overview with Pressure Relationships

The cardiac cycle can be summarized showing the relationship between atrial, ventricular, and arterial pressures. During diastole (ventricular filling), pressure in the ventricle is lowest, allowing blood to flow from the higher-pressure atrium. During systole (ventricular ejection), ventricular muscle contraction raises ventricular pressure above arterial pressure, forcing blood into the arteries. The pressure in each chamber fluctuates throughout the cycle, with these pressure changes determining valve states. Understanding these pressure relationships is essential for recognizing normal cardiac function and identifying pathological conditions.

**Key details:**

- Pressure gradients drive blood flow
- Diastole: atrial pressure > ventricular pressure
- Systole: ventricular pressure > arterial pressure
- Pressure fluctuations determine valve opening/closing
- Atrial, ventricular, and arterial pressures all change cyclically

**Slide reference:** Slide 46 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 6.6: Diastole Part 1—Isovolemic Relaxation

Diastole begins after the semilunar valves to the aorta and pulmonary artery close. The ventricular musculature relaxes to its baseline state, a process called isovolemic (or isovolumetric) relaxation because ventricular volume remains constant during this phase. During the preceding systole, the atria have filled with blood from their respective venous returns (systemic and pulmonary venous blood). As ventricular pressure drops below atrial pressure, the AV valves will open to begin ventricular filling. The time for this initial part of diastole is approximately 0.05 seconds. The term "isovolemic" reflects that no blood enters or leaves the ventricle during this brief relaxation phase.

**Key details:**

- Begins after semilunar valve closure
- Ventricular muscle relaxes to baseline
- Called isovolemic/isovolumetric relaxation
- Ventricular volume constant during this phase
- Atria filled with blood from venous return during previous systole
- Duration: ~0.05 seconds
- Ends when AV valves open

**Slide reference:** Slide 47 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 6.7: Diastole Part 2—Ventricular Filling and Atrial Contraction

When ventricular pressure falls below atrial pressure, the AV valves open and blood flows from the atria into the ventricles. This passive filling accounts for approximately seventy-five percent of ventricular filling. Contraction of the atrial musculature occurs during the final part of diastole and accounts for approximately twenty-five percent of blood flow from atria to ventricles, actively pushing the remaining blood into the ventricles. The atrial contraction propagates from the top of the atria downward, optimizing blood transfer to the ventricles. The time for this part of diastole is approximately 0.6 seconds at normal resting heart rate. The combined passive filling and active atrial contraction ensure maximal ventricular blood volume before systole begins.

**Key details:**

- AV valves open when ventricular pressure < atrial pressure
- Blood flows from atria to ventricles
- Passive filling: ~75% of ventricular filling
- Atrial contraction: final ~25% of ventricular filling
- Atrial contraction occurs in late diastole
- Contraction direction: atrial top downward
- Duration: ~0.6 seconds
- Maximizes ventricular blood volume

**Slide reference:** Slide 48 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 6.8: Diastole Summary

Diastole can be summarized in four steps. First, during diastole's beginning, the ventricular wall musculature relaxes and pressure in the ventricle drops. Second, when ventricular pressure is lower than arterial pressure, the relevant semilunar valve closes, initiating isovolemic relaxation. Third, when ventricular pressure eventually becomes lower than atrial pressure, the relevant AV valve opens and actual ventricular filling begins as blood flows down into the ventricle from the atrium through the opened AV valve. Fourth, during the later part of diastole, the atrial musculature contracts to press down the last quarter of blood from the atrium to the ventricle, with contraction occurring from the atria's top downward. This sequence ensures complete ventricular filling before the next systole.

**Key details:**

- Step 1: Ventricular muscle relaxation, pressure drops
- Step 2: Ventricular pressure < arterial pressure → semilunar valve closes → isovolemic relaxation begins
- Step 3: Ventricular pressure < atrial pressure → AV valve opens → ventricular filling begins
- Step 4: Atrial contraction pushes final ~25% of blood into ventricle
- Atrial contraction from top downward
- Complete sequence prepares ventricle for systole

**Slide reference:** Slide 49 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 6.9: Systole Part 1—Isovolemic Contraction

Systole begins with ventricular muscle contraction, marking the period during the cardiac cycle when ventricular musculature contracts and blood leaves the heart. When ventricular pressure rapidly exceeds atrial pressure, the AV valves close. The valves to the aorta and pulmonary artery remain closed until ventricular pressure exceeds the pressure in these vessels. This phase is called isovolemic (or isovolumetric) contraction because ventricular volume remains constant while pressure builds. The time for this part of systole is approximately 0.05 seconds. During this brief phase, both sets of valves are closed and ventricular pressure rises rapidly without any blood movement.

**Key details:**

- Systole: period when ventricular musculature contracts
- Ventricular contraction begins
- Ventricular pressure exceeds atrial pressure → AV valves close
- Semilunar valves remain closed until ventricular pressure exceeds arterial pressure
- Called isovolemic/isovolumetric contraction
- Ventricular volume constant during this phase
- Duration: ~0.05 seconds
- Both valve sets closed simultaneously

**Slide reference:** Slide 50 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 6.10: Systole Part 2—Ventricular Ejection

During the ejection phase of systole, when ventricular pressure exceeds the pressure in the aorta and pulmonary artery respectively, the valves to these vessels open and blood begins flowing out of the ventricles. As the ventricular muscles begin to relax, pressure in the aorta and pulmonary artery exceeds ventricular pressure, and the valves to these vessels close. The time for this part of systole is approximately 0.3 seconds. This ejection phase represents the actual pumping action of the heart, with blood being forced from the ventricles into the arterial systems. Valve closure at the end of ejection prevents backflow and marks the transition to the next diastole.

**Key details:**

- Ejection begins when ventricular pressure > arterial pressure
- Semilunar valves open
- Blood flows from ventricles to arteries
- As ventricular muscles relax, arterial pressure > ventricular pressure
- Semilunar valves close
- Duration: ~0.3 seconds
- Represents actual pumping action
- Valve closure prevents backflow

**Slide reference:** Slide 51 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 6.11: Systole Summary

Systole encompasses the period when ventricular musculature contracts. First, the contraction of ventricular musculature begins at the heart's apex and proceeds upward through the ventricular walls. Second, during contraction of the ventricular walls, pressure in the ventricle increases. Third, when ventricular pressure exceeds atrial pressure, the relevant AV valve closes, initiating isovolemic contraction. Fourth, when ventricular pressure eventually exceeds arterial pressure, the relevant semilunar valve opens and actual ventricular emptying begins as blood leaves the ventricle for the artery through the now-opened semilunar valve. Fifth, ventricular emptying continues as long as ventricular pressure is higher than arterial pressure. Sixth, when ventricular musculature begins to relax, the transition into the next diastole occurs. This coordinated sequence ensures efficient blood ejection.

**Key details:**

- Systole: ventricular muscle contraction period
- Step 1: Contraction begins at heart apex, proceeds upward
- Step 2: Ventricular pressure increases during contraction
- Step 3: Ventricular pressure > atrial pressure → AV valve closes → isovolemic contraction
- Step 4: Ventricular pressure > arterial pressure → semilunar valve opens → ejection begins
- Step 5: Ejection continues while ventricular pressure > arterial pressure
- Step 6: Muscle relaxation begins → transition to diastole
- Coordinated apex-to-base contraction optimizes ejection

**Slide reference:** Slide 52 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 6.12: Enhanced Cardiac Cycle Diagram

The cardiac cycle can be represented as a diagram showing the relationships between atrial, ventricular, and arterial pressures with valve states. During diastole, blood flows from atrium to ventricle with AV valves open and semilunar valves closed. During systole, blood flows from ventricle to artery with semilunar valves open and AV valves closed. The pressure curves for each chamber intersect at valve transition points, with valve opening occurring when upstream pressure exceeds downstream pressure and closure occurring when this relationship reverses. This graphical representation helps visualize the temporal relationships between pressure changes and valve movements throughout the cardiac cycle.

**Key details:**

- Diagram shows atrial, ventricular, and arterial pressure relationships
- Diastole: atrium → ventricle flow
- Systole: ventricle → artery flow
- Valve transitions occur at pressure curve intersections
- Visual representation of temporal relationships
- Helps understand normal and abnormal cardiac function

## Topic 7: Wiggers Diagram and Cardiac Parameters

### Overview

The Wiggers diagram provides a comprehensive graphical representation of the cardiac cycle, integrating pressure changes in the left atrium, left ventricle, and aorta with valve movements and heart sounds. This diagram demonstrates how pressure relationships determine valve opening and closing: the bicuspid (mitral) valve opens when left ventricular pressure falls below left atrial pressure during diastole, closes when ventricular pressure exceeds atrial pressure (producing the first heart sound "lubb"), the aortic valve opens when ventricular pressure exceeds aortic pressure during systole, and closes when ventricular pressure falls below aortic pressure (producing the second heart sound "dubb"). Additional cardiac parameters including stroke volume, end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and cardiac output quantify heart performance and can be derived from pressure-volume relationships. Understanding these parameters is essential for assessing cardiac function in both health and disease.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 7.1: Wiggers Diagram—Pressure Changes During Cardiac Cycle

The Wiggers diagram graphically presents pressure changes in the left heart during the cardiac cycle. The vertical axis shows pressure in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) from zero to 120, while the horizontal axis represents time through diastole and systole phases. Three pressure curves are shown: left atrial pressure (lowest curve), left ventricular pressure (fluctuating dramatically), and aortic pressure (intermediate curve). Key valve events are marked: the bicuspid (mitral) valve opens when ventricular pressure drops below atrial pressure during diastole, closes when ventricular pressure exceeds atrial pressure (producing heart sound 1, "lubb"), the aortic valve opens when ventricular pressure exceeds aortic pressure, and closes when ventricular pressure falls below aortic pressure (producing heart sound 2, "dubb"). This diagram is fundamental for understanding cardiac hemodynamics.

**Key details:**

- Pressure scale: 0-120 mm Hg
- Three curves: left atrium, left ventricle, aorta
- Bicuspid valve opens: ventricular pressure < atrial pressure (diastole)
- Bicuspid valve closes: ventricular pressure > atrial pressure (heart sound 1, "lubb")
- Aortic valve opens: ventricular pressure > aortic pressure (systole)
- Aortic valve closes: aortic pressure > ventricular pressure (heart sound 2, "dubb")
- Visualizes pressure-driven valve movements

**Slide reference:** Slide 54 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 7.2: Volume Changes in Ventricle During Cardiac Cycle

The volume changes in the ventricle during contraction can be visualized in a pressure-volume diagram. The vertical axis shows ventricular pressure (zero to 120 mm Hg), while the horizontal axis shows ventricular volume (sixty to 120 mL for this example). End-diastolic volume (EDV) is the blood volume in the ventricle at diastole's end, end-systolic volume (ESV) is the blood volume in the ventricle at systole's end, and stroke volume (SV) equals EDV minus ESV. The diagram traces a loop showing ventricular filling (volume increases at low pressure), isovolemic contraction (pressure increases at constant volume), ejection (volume decreases at high pressure), and isovolemic relaxation (pressure decreases at constant volume). This pressure-volume loop provides comprehensive information about ventricular function.

**Key details:**

- Pressure-volume diagram for left ventricle
- End-diastolic volume (EDV): volume at end of diastole
- End-systolic volume (ESV): volume at end of systole
- Stroke volume (SV) = EDV - ESV
- Loop traces: filling → isovolemic contraction → ejection → isovolemic relaxation
- Provides comprehensive ventricular function information

**Slide reference:** Slide 55 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 7.3: Cardiac Minute Volume (Cardiac Output)

The cardiac minute volume, also called cardiac output, is the amount of blood leaving each ventricle per minute. Minute volume equals stroke volume (SV) multiplied by heart rate (HR). Stroke volume is the volume of blood leaving the ventricle per individual heartbeat, and heart rate is the number of heartbeats per minute. For a "normal" person at rest: SV × HR = 70 mL × 70 beats/min ≈ 5 liters per minute. For a well-trained person during hard physical activity: SV × HR = 140 mL × 200 beats/min ≈ 30 liters per minute. This demonstrates that cardiac output can increase approximately six-fold during maximal exercise through increases in both stroke volume and heart rate.

**Key details:**

- Minute volume (cardiac output) = amount of blood leaving each ventricle per minute
- Formula: Minute volume = Stroke volume (SV) × Heart rate (HR)
- SV: blood volume per heartbeat
- HR: heartbeats per minute
- Normal rest: 70 mL × 70 beats/min ≈ 5 L/min
- Trained person, hard exercise: 140 mL × 200 beats/min ≈ 30 L/min
- ~6-fold increase possible during maximal exercise

**Slide reference:** Slide 56 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 7.4: Reference Values for Cardiac Minute Volume

Reference values for cardiac parameters show normal ranges at rest and extreme values for a well-trained person during hard physical exertion. Stroke volume at rest is approximately 70 mL (normal range 55-100 mL), increasing to greater than 140 mL during hard exercise (approximately two-fold increase). Heart rate at rest is approximately 70 beats/minute (normal range 60-100 beats/min), increasing to less than 210 beats/min during hard exercise (approximately three-fold increase). Minute volume at rest is approximately 5 liters/minute (normal range 4-8 L/min), increasing to greater than 30 liters/min during hard exercise (approximately six-fold increase). The six-fold increase in cardiac output results from the combined two-fold increase in stroke volume and three-fold increase in heart rate. Note that primarily the diastole length decreases with increased heart rate.

**Key details:**

- Stroke volume rest: ~70 mL (55-100), exercise: >140 mL (~2× increase)
- Heart rate rest: ~70 beats/min (60-100), exercise: <210 beats/min (~3× increase)
- Minute volume rest: ~5 L/min (4-8), exercise: >30 L/min (~6× increase)
- 6× cardiac output increase = 2× SV increase × 3× HR increase
- Increased heart rate primarily shortens diastole duration

**Slide reference:** Slide 57 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 7.5: Regulation of Cardiac Minute Volume Overview

The regulation of cardiac minute volume involves multiple factors affecting stroke volume and heart rate. Stroke volume is influenced by ventricular muscle contraction strength (determining end-systolic volume) and venous return (determining end-diastolic volume). Heart rate is determined by the frequency of action potentials in sinoatrial node cells. Venous return itself depends on blood volume and flow-increasing mechanisms such as skeletal muscle pump and respiratory pump. Ventricular contraction strength is modulated by sympathetic nervous system activity. This multifactorial regulation allows the cardiovascular system to match cardiac output to metabolic demands dynamically.

**Key details:**

- Minute volume = Stroke volume × Heart rate
- Stroke volume determined by:
    - Ventricular muscle contraction strength (= end-systolic volume)
    - Venous return (= end-diastolic volume)
- Heart rate determined by: action potential frequency in SA node
- Venous return depends on: blood volume + flow-increasing mechanisms
- Multiple factors allow dynamic cardiac output adjustment

**Slide reference:** Slide 58 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 7.6: Preload and Afterload Concepts

Preload and afterload are important concepts in cardiac physiology. Preload is the pressure created by blood filling the ventricle during diastole, reflecting the end-diastolic volume. A stroke volume versus preload graph shows that as more blood fills the ventricle, stroke volume increases automatically due to the Frank-Starling mechanism. Afterload is the pressure resistance that the left ventricle must overcome to eject blood into the aorta, primarily determined by aortic pressure and systemic vascular resistance. A stroke volume versus afterload graph shows that at higher afterload, it becomes harder to pump blood out and consequently stroke volume decreases. These concepts are clinically important for understanding heart function and the effects of various cardiovascular conditions and medications.

**Key details:**

- Preload: pressure from blood filling ventricle during diastole
- Higher preload (more filling) → larger stroke volume (Frank-Starling mechanism)
- Automatic relationship between filling and stroke volume
- Afterload: pressure resistance ventricle must overcome to eject blood
- Higher afterload → harder to pump → reduced stroke volume
- Clinically important for understanding cardiac function

## Topic 8: Abdominal Wall Musculature

### Overview

The abdominal wall musculature consists of multiple layers of muscles that provide structural support for abdominal organs, contribute to trunk flexion and rotation, assist in respiration, and generate intra-abdominal pressure for functions such as defecation, urination, and childbirth. The rectus abdominis forms the anterior midline muscular structure, while three lateral muscle layers—the external oblique (m. obliquus externus abdominis), internal oblique (m. obliquus internus abdominis), and transversus abdominis—create a strong, multilayered lateral abdominal wall. These muscles originate from the lower ribs and insert onto the pelvis, with the linea alba (a connective tissue structure running from sternum to pubis) serving as a midline anchor point. Together, these muscles form a flexible yet strong containment system for abdominal contents.

#### Subtopic 8.1: Rectus Abdominis Muscle

The musculus rectus abdominis (raka bukmuskeln/straight abdominal muscle) has its origin at the costal cartilage of ribs 5-7 (os costae 5-7) and the xiphoid process (processus xiphoideus) of the sternum. Its insertion point is on the pubic bone (os pubis), which is part of the hip bone (os coxae). The function of this muscle includes forming part of the abdominal wall and contributing to flexion of the trunk. This paired muscle runs vertically on each side of the midline, separated by the linea alba. It provides anterior abdominal strength and is the muscle that creates the "six-pack" appearance when well-developed and visible.

**Key details:**

- Muscle: Musculus rectus abdominis (straight abdominal muscle)
- Origin: Costal cartilage of ribs 5-7, xiphoid process of sternum
- Insertion: Os pubis (part of os coxae/hip bone)
- Function: Forms abdominal wall, trunk flexion
- Paired muscles on either side of midline
- Separated by linea alba

**Slide reference:** Slide 60 (Lecture 11)

#### Subtopic 8.2: Lateral Abdominal Wall Muscles

Three muscles together constitute the lateral abdominal wall: the external oblique (m. obliquus externus abdominis/yttre sneda bukmuskeln), internal oblique (m. obliquus internus abdominis/inre sneda bukmuskeln), and transversus abdominis (bukmuskeln). These muscles form layers with different fiber orientations, creating a strong, flexible wall. The linea alba is a connective tissue band running the entire distance between the sternum (breastbone) and the hip bone (os coxae). This multilayered arrangement provides strength in multiple directions, allows trunk rotation, and contributes to increased intra-abdominal pressure. The oblique fiber orientations of the three layers create a lattice-like structure that resists forces from multiple directions.

**Key details:**

- Three lateral muscles:
    - M. obliquus externus abdominis (external oblique)
    - M. obliquus internus abdominis (internal oblique)
    - M. transversus abdominis (transverse abdominal)
- Together form lateral abdominal wall
- Multiple layers with different fiber orientations
- Linea alba: connective tissue band from sternum to os coxae
- Provides multidirectional strength
- Enables trunk rotation

## Topic 9: Cardiac Conduction System and Action Potentials (Lecture 12)

### Overview

The heart's rhythmic contraction depends on a specialized electrical conduction system that coordinates contraction of billions of cardiac muscle cells. The sinoatrial (SA) node contains autorhythmic cells that spontaneously generate action potentials at approximately 100 beats per minute, serving as the heart's primary pacemaker. These electrical signals spread through gap junctions between cardiac myocytes, following a specific pathway: from SA node through atrial muscle to the atrioventricular (AV) node (where conduction is delayed), then through the Bundle of His (the only electrical connection through the fibrous annulus), dividing into left and right bundle branches, spreading through Purkinje fibers to the ventricular apex, and finally propagating upward through ventricular muscle. This orchestrated conduction pattern ensures that atria contract before ventricles and that ventricular contraction proceeds from apex to base, optimizing pumping efficiency. The action potentials in cardiac muscle cells differ fundamentally from those in skeletal muscle or neurons, with cardiac myocytes exhibiting a prolonged plateau phase that prevents tetanic contraction and ensures adequate filling time.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 9.1: Layers of the Heart Wall

The heart wall consists of multiple distinct layers. The myocardium contains contractile cardiac muscle cells that generate the force for pumping. The endocardium is the innermost layer consisting of endothelium and connective tissue that lines the heart chambers. The epicardium is the visceral layer of the pericardium covering the heart's outer surface. The parietal layer of the pericardium forms the outer sac. The pericardial cavity lies between the visceral and parietal pericardial layers. The subendocardium contains Purkinje fibers in certain parts of the heart, which are specialized for rapid conduction. Blood vessels supplying the heart wall itself also course through these layers. This layered structure provides both mechanical strength and electrical organization.

**Key details:**

- Myocardium: contractile cardiac muscle cells
- Endocardium: endothelium and connective tissue (innermost layer)
- Epicardium: visceral pericardial layer (outer heart surface)
- Parietal pericardium: outer sac layer
- Pericardial cavity: space between epicardium and parietal pericardium
- Subendocardium: contains Purkinje fibers in some regions
- Blood vessels within heart wall

**Slide reference:** Slide 1 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 9.2: Origin of Heart Contraction

The origin of cardiac contraction involves two types of cardiac muscle cells. Autorhythmic cardiac muscle cells spontaneously generate action potentials without external stimulation. Contractile cardiac muscle cells respond to electrical signals but do not spontaneously depolarize. The spread of the contraction signal in the heart depends on sodium (Na⁺) and calcium (Ca²⁺) influx from neighboring cardiac muscle cells through gap junctions. Autorhythmic cells initiate the electrical signal, which then propagates to contractile cells. The gap junctions connecting cardiac myocytes allow rapid electrical communication, enabling coordinated contraction of billions of cells as a functional syncytium.

**Key details:**

- Two cell types in heart:
    - Autorhythmic cardiac muscle cells: spontaneous action potentials
    - Contractile cardiac muscle cells: respond to signals, don't spontaneously depolarize
- Signal spread via gap junctions between cells
- Na⁺ and Ca²⁺ influx from neighboring cells
- Autorhythmic cells initiate signal
- Gap junctions enable coordinated contraction

**Slide reference:** Slide 2 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 9.3: Role of the Sinoatrial Node

The sinoatrial (SA) node cells spontaneously generate action potentials with a baseline frequency of 100 beats per minute. This frequency can be modulated by the autonomic nervous system. The SA node (nodus sinuatrialis), also called the sinusknutan in Swedish, serves as the heart's primary pacemaker. Autorhythmic cardiac muscle cells in the SA node are connected to contractile cardiac muscle cells via gap junctions, allowing the pacemaker signal to spread. The intrinsic rate of 100 beats/min is modified downward by parasympathetic tone to the typical resting heart rate of approximately 70 beats/min, demonstrating that the autonomic nervous system continuously modulates cardiac pacing.

**Key details:**

- SA node (Sinoatrial node, nodus sinuatrialis)
- Contains autorhythmic cardiac muscle cells
- Spontaneous action potential generation
- Baseline frequency: 100 beats/min
- Modulated by autonomic nervous system
- Connected to contractile cells via gap junctions
- Primary pacemaker of heart

**Slide reference:** Slide 3 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 9.4: Initiation of Action Potentials in SA Node

Action potentials in SA node cells are initiated through a unique mechanism involving spontaneous depolarization. First, sodium (Na⁺) diffuses into the cell through "leaky" sodium channels that allow continuous influx even at resting potential. This creates a pacemaker potential (spontaneous depolarization) that gradually brings the membrane potential toward threshold. Second, when threshold is reached, voltage-gated calcium (Ca²⁺) channels open, and calcium influx triggers an action potential with the upstroke reaching approximately +30 mV. Third, potassium (K⁺) outflow through voltage-gated potassium channels repolarizes the membrane back to approximately -60 mV. Once repolarization is complete, the cycle begins again with sodium leaking in. This automaticity distinguishes pacemaker cells from other excitable cells that require external stimuli.

**Key details:**

- Step 1: Na⁺ leaks in through "leaky" Na⁺ channels → spontaneous depolarization (pacemaker potential)
- Step 2: Threshold reached → voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels open → action potential (~+30 mV)
- Step 3: Voltage-gated K⁺ channels open → K⁺ outflow → repolarization (~-60 mV)
- Cycle repeats automatically
- No external stimulus required
- Creates automaticity

**Slide reference:** Slide 4 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 9.5: Comparison of Different Action Potentials

Different excitable cells show distinct action potential characteristics. The action potential in SA node cells reaches approximately +30 mV at peak, has a resting potential near -60 mV, and features spontaneous depolarization (pacemaker potential) driven by leaky Na⁺ channels. The upstroke depends on Ca²⁺ influx, and repolarization involves K⁺ outflow. In contrast, a motor neuron action potential requires external stimuli (no spontaneous process), has a more negative resting potential near -90 mV, and depends on voltage-gated Na⁺ channels for depolarization and voltage-gated K⁺ channels for repolarization. The SA node's spontaneous activity and calcium-dependent upstroke distinguish it fundamentally from neurons and skeletal muscle cells.

**Key details:**

- SA node cell:
    - Spontaneous depolarization (pacemaker potential)
    - Ca²⁺-dependent upstroke
    - K⁺-dependent repolarization
    - No external stimulus needed
    - Peak ~+30 mV, baseline ~-60 mV
- Motor neuron:
    - Requires external stimuli
    - Na⁺-dependent upstroke
    - K⁺-dependent repolarization
    - Peak ~+30 mV, resting ~-90 mV

**Slide reference:** Slide 5 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 9.6: Contraction Directions During Cardiac Cycle

The contraction of cardiac muscle follows specific directional patterns during the cardiac cycle. During late diastole, atrial musculature contracts starting in the region nearest the SA node, with the contraction continuing downward through the atrial musculature so that blood is pressed down into the respective ventricles. After atrial musculature contraction is complete, ventricular musculature begins contracting starting at the heart's apex (bottom tip). The contraction of ventricular musculature continues upward so that blood is pressed out to the respective arteries. This apex-to-base ventricular contraction pattern optimizes blood ejection by squeezing blood toward the arterial outflow tracts at the ventricular base.

**Key details:**

- Late diastole: atrial contraction
    - Starts near SA node
    - Proceeds downward through atria
    - Presses blood into ventricles
- Systole: ventricular contraction
    - Starts at heart apex
    - Proceeds upward toward base
    - Presses blood into arteries
- Optimizes ejection efficiency

**Slide reference:** Slide 6 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 9.7: Heart's Conduction System Components

The heart's conduction system consists of specialized structures that coordinate electrical activity. The sinoatrial (SA) node initiates action potentials. The atrioventricular (AV) node receives signals from the atria and introduces a delay. The Bundle of His (Hiska bunten) conducts signals through the fibrous annulus. The annulus fibrosus is an electrically isolating connective tissue structure that separates atria from ventricles. The right and left bundle branches (höger and vänster skänkel) distribute signals to respective ventricles. Purkinje fibers rapidly spread signals throughout ventricular myocardium. Different autorhythmic cells in this system can take over pacemaker function if the SA node fails, but they generate action potentials at lower frequencies than the SA node.

**Key details:**

- SA node (sinoatrial node): primary pacemaker
- AV node (atrioventricular node): delays conduction
- Annulus fibrosus: electrically isolating fibrous ring
- Bundle of His (Hiska bunten): conducts through annulus
- Right and left bundle branches: distribute to ventricles
- Purkinje fibers: rapid ventricular conduction
- Backup pacemakers possible if SA node fails

**Slide reference:** Slide 7 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 9.8: Signal Spread Through Heart Conduction System

The signal for cardiac contraction spreads through the heart via a specific pathway. First, spontaneous action potentials are generated in the SA node. Second, the signal spreads through gap junctions in the atrial musculature, with each individual contractile cardiac muscle cell spreading the signal downward until reaching the annulus fibrosus (which blocks direct atrial-to-ventricular conduction). Third, the signal arrives at the AV node where a delay occurs. Fourth, the signal spreads through the Bundle of His, the only electrical connection through the annulus fibrosus. Fifth, via Purkinje fibers, the signal spreads down to the heart's apex, where Purkinje fibers are interconnected via gap junctions with contractile cardiac muscle cells in the ventricular wall. Sixth, the contraction signal now spreads upward through ventricular musculature via gap junctions interconnecting individual contractile cardiac muscle cells.

**Key details:**

- Step 1: SA node generates spontaneous action potentials
- Step 2: Spreads through atrial muscle via gap junctions until annulus fibrosus
- Step 3: Arrives at AV node, delay occurs
- Step 4: Conducts through Bundle of His (only pathway through annulus fibrosus)
- Step 5: Purkinje fibers spread signal to ventricular apex
- Step 6: Spreads upward through ventricular muscle via gap junctions
- Annulus fibrosus prevents direct atrial-ventricular conduction

**Slide reference:** Slides 8-9 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 9.9: Signal Transmission in Atria

The electrical signal transmission in the atria begins with action potential generation in the SA node's autorhythmic cells. These action potentials propagate to contractile cardiac muscle cells in the atrial wall through gap junctions, with diffusion of positive ions (Na⁺ and Ca²⁺) serving as the communication mechanism. Each atrial muscle cell that depolarizes spreads the signal to its neighbors, creating a wave of depolarization that travels through the atrial myocardium. This cell-to-cell spread continues until the signal reaches the annulus fibrosus, which blocks further direct transmission. The only pathway forward is through the AV node to the Bundle of His.

**Key details:**

- SA node autorhythmic cells generate action potentials
- Signal spreads via gap junctions to atrial contractile cells
- Na⁺ and Ca²⁺ diffusion between cells
- Wave of depolarization through atrial muscle
- Continues until reaching annulus fibrosus
- AV node is next conduction point

**Slide reference:** Slide 10 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 9.10: Signal Transmission to Ventricles

Signal transmission from atria to ventricles requires passage through specialized structures. After spreading through atrial muscle, the signal reaches the AV node where conduction velocity slows, creating a delay. From the AV node, the signal passes through the Bundle of His, which penetrates the annulus fibrosus. The bundle then divides into right and left bundle branches. Purkinje fibers extend from the bundle branches to the ventricular apex and throughout the ventricular walls. Finally, the signal spreads from Purkinje fibers to contractile ventricular muscle cells via gap junctions. The AV nodal delay ensures that atria complete contraction before ventricles begin, optimizing ventricular filling.

**Key details:**

- AV node: conduction slows (delay)
- Bundle of His: conducts through annulus fibrosus
- Right and left bundle branches
- Purkinje fibers: rapid conduction to apex and walls
- Signal spreads from Purkinje fibers to ventricular muscle via gap junctions
- Delay ensures sequential atrial-ventricular contraction

**Slide reference:** Slides 8-10 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 9.11: Comprehensive Summary of Cardiac Contraction Signal

The complete pathway of cardiac contraction signaling can be summarized in six steps. First, the contraction signal is created in the SA node where autorhythmic cardiac muscle cells spontaneously generate action potentials. Second, the signal spreads through diffusion of positive ions via gap junctions to atrial musculature, with each individual contractile cardiac muscle cell spreading the signal downward until reaching the annulus fibrosus. Third, the signal arrives at the AV node where some delay occurs. Fourth, the signal spreads through the Bundle of His passing through the annulus fibrosus. Fifth, via Purkinje fibers, the signal spreads down to the heart's apex where Purkinje fibers connect via gap junctions with contractile cardiac muscle cells in the ventricular wall. Sixth, the contraction signal spreads upward through ventricular musculature via gap junctions interconnecting the individual contractile cardiac muscle cells.

**Key details:**

- Complete 6-step pathway:
    1. SA node: spontaneous action potential generation
    2. Atrial muscle: gap junction spread until annulus fibrosus
    3. AV node: delay
    4. Bundle of His: through annulus fibrosus
    5. Purkinje fibers: to ventricular apex
    6. Ventricular muscle: upward spread via gap junctions
- Ensures coordinated contraction sequence
- Optimizes cardiac output

## Topic 10: Contractile Cardiac Muscle Cell Structure and Function

### Overview

Contractile cardiac muscle cells contain highly organized contractile machinery consisting of sarcomeres arranged in series, with each sarcomere containing interdigitating actin and myosin filaments. These cells contain an exceptionally large number of mitochondria (occupying approximately one-third of cell volume), reflecting the heart's enormous energy demands for continuous contraction. Cardiac myocytes are interconnected by intercalated discs containing both desmosomes (for mechanical coupling) and gap junctions (for electrical coupling), allowing them to function as a syncytium. The sarcoplasmic reticulum serves as an extensive internal calcium storage system, and the plasma membrane features invaginations called T-tubules that allow action potentials to penetrate deep into the cell. The contractile process depends on calcium-induced calcium release: a small amount of extracellular calcium entering during the action potential triggers massive calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which then binds to troponin to initiate contraction. The prolonged action potential plateau in cardiac muscle (lasting several hundred milliseconds compared to a few milliseconds in skeletal muscle) prevents tetanic contraction and ensures adequate time for ventricular filling between beats.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 10.1: Structure of Contractile Cardiac Muscle Cell

The contractile cardiac muscle cell contains several key structural features. Mitochondria occupy approximately one-third of the cardiac muscle cell's volume, reflecting high metabolic energy demands. Sarcomeres are the repeating contractile units containing myosin (thick) and actin (thin) filaments with associated regulatory proteins including tropomyosin. Intercalated discs (kittskivor) are specialized cell-cell junctions containing desmosomes (mechanical attachment) and gap junctions (electrical communication). This organization allows cardiac myocytes to function as an electrical and mechanical syncytium despite being individual cells. The high mitochondrial content supports the continuous ATP demand for both contraction and ion pumping.

**Key details:**

- Mitochondria: ~1/3 of cell volume
- Sarcomeres: contractile units with actin and myosin filaments
- Tropomyosin: regulatory protein on actin
- Intercalated discs/kittskivor: specialized junctions
- Desmosomes: mechanical coupling
- Gap junctions: electrical coupling
- High energy demand reflected in mitochondrial abundance

**Slide reference:** Slide 12 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 10.2: Sarcoplasmic Reticulum as Calcium Depot

Contractile cardiac muscle cells contain a well-developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum called the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The SR stores large amounts of calcium ions (Ca²⁺) that are essential for contraction. The concentration of Ca²⁺ is high outside the cell and inside the SR, but low in the cytosol under resting conditions. This steep concentration gradient is maintained by active transport. When the cell is stimulated, Ca²⁺ flows from the SR into the cytosol, raising cytosolic calcium concentration and initiating contraction. When stimulation ends, Ca²⁺ is actively pumped back into the SR and out of the cell, lowering cytosolic calcium and allowing relaxation.

**Key details:**

- Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR): well-developed smooth ER
- Stores large amounts of Ca²⁺
- Ca²⁺ concentration:
    - High: outside cell and in SR
    - Low: in cytosol (resting state)
- Ca²⁺ release from SR triggers contraction
- Ca²⁺ removal allows relaxation

**Slide reference:** Slide 13 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 10.3: Calcium-Regulating Mechanisms in Unstimulated Cardiac Myocyte

In the unstimulated cardiac muscle cell, the concentration of calcium (Ca²⁺) in the cytosol is very low. ATP-dependent calcium pumps continuously "vacuum" the cytosol for any Ca²⁺ that leaks in from the cell's exterior or the sarcoplasmic reticulum. One type of pump uses ATP hydrolysis directly to move Ca²⁺ against its concentration gradient. Another mechanism is the sodium-dependent calcium pump, which uses the sodium gradient (created by Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase) to drive calcium out of the cell through a Na⁺-Ca²⁺ exchanger. These mechanisms maintain the low resting cytosolic calcium concentration essential for muscle relaxation.

**Key details:**

- Resting cytosolic Ca²⁺ very low
- ATP-dependent Ca²⁺ pumps continuously remove cytosolic Ca²⁺
- Two removal mechanisms:
    - ATP-dependent Ca²⁺ pump: direct ATP use
    - Na⁺-dependent Ca²⁺ pump: uses Na⁺ gradient
- Remove Ca²⁺ leaking from outside and SR
- Maintain low resting Ca²⁺ for relaxation

**Slide reference:** Slide 14 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 10.4: Calcium Mobilization Leading to Contraction

When a cardiac muscle cell is to contract, it is desirable that all parts of the cell contract simultaneously. To enable this, Ca²⁺ needs to be released more or less simultaneously from the muscle cell's sarcoplasmic reticulum throughout the cell. Mobilization of Ca²⁺ from the cell's SR leads to contraction. During contraction of the cardiac muscle cell, Ca²⁺ is released into the cytosol primarily (greater than 80 percent) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, with a smaller amount entering from outside the cell. This Ca²⁺ release must occur nearly simultaneously in all sarcomeres throughout the cell to produce coordinated contraction.

**Key details:**

- Simultaneous contraction of all cell parts required
- Ca²⁺ released simultaneously from SR throughout cell
- During contraction:
    - > 80% of Ca²⁺ from sarcoplasmic reticulum
        
    - <20% from extracellular space
- Coordinated Ca²⁺ release produces coordinated contraction
- Sarcomeres throughout cell respond together

**Slide reference:** Slide 15 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 10.5: T-Tubules and Action Potential Propagation into Cell

Cardiac muscle cells (and skeletal muscle cells) have invaginations of the plasma membrane called T-tubules (T-rör) that reach the cell's deeper parts. The spread of the contraction signal in the muscle cell depends on an action potential forming on the cell surface, with the signal then spreading through formation of additional action potentials along the T-tubules. This allows the action potential to reach deep into the cell interior rapidly, ensuring that Ca²⁺ release can occur nearly simultaneously throughout the cell. The T-tubule system effectively brings the cell surface into close proximity with the sarcoplasmic reticulum throughout the cell volume.

**Key details:**

- T-tubules (T-rör): plasma membrane invaginations
- Reach deep into cell interior
- Action potential forms on cell surface
- Signal spreads through additional action potentials along T-tubules
- Allows rapid signal penetration to cell interior
- Enables simultaneous Ca²⁺ release throughout cell

**Slide reference:** Slide 16 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 10.6: Initial Action Potential Creation in Contractile Cardiac Myocyte

The initial action potential in a contractile cardiac muscle cell is created when the plasma membrane depolarizes due to influx of positive ions from neighboring cells through gap junctions. The action potential depends on opening of voltage-gated sodium (Na⁺) channels, which open when their threshold is reached due to positive ions that diffused into the cell from the adjacent cell. This cell-to-cell communication allows the electrical signal to propagate through the myocardium as a wave. Once threshold is reached in one cell, that cell generates its own action potential, which can then depolarize the next cell, creating a chain reaction of depolarization.

**Key details:**

- Step 1: Positive ions diffuse in from neighboring cells via gap junctions
- Causes local membrane depolarization
- Step 2: Depolarization reaches threshold for voltage-gated Na⁺ channels
- Na⁺ channels open → Na⁺ influx
- Initiates action potential
- Creates chain reaction through myocardium

**Slide reference:** Slide 17 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 10.7: Action Potential in Cardiac Muscle Cell Plasma Membrane

The action potential in the cardiac muscle cell's plasma membrane has a distinctive shape due to the specific composition of voltage-gated ion channels. The upstroke begins with rapid sodium (Na⁺) influx through voltage-gated Na⁺ channels. A plateau phase follows, during which simultaneous calcium (Ca²⁺) influx and potassium (K⁺) outflow occur through voltage-gated Ca²⁺ and K⁺ channels respectively. The simultaneous influx of positive Ca²⁺ ions and outflow of positive K⁺ ions maintains the membrane potential at an elevated "plateau" level of approximately zero millivolts for several hundred milliseconds. Finally, Ca²⁺ channels close while K⁺ channels remain open, causing repolarization. This prolonged plateau distinguishes cardiac action potentials from those in skeletal muscle or neurons.

**Key details:**

- Phase 1: Na⁺ influx through voltage-gated Na⁺ channels (upstroke)
- Phase 2: Plateau phase
    - Simultaneous Ca²⁺ influx and K⁺ outflow
    - Voltage-gated Ca²⁺ and K⁺ channels open
    - Membrane potential maintained at ~0 mV
    - Duration: ~200-300 milliseconds
- Phase 3: K⁺ outflow continues, Ca²⁺ channels close (repolarization)
- Phase 4: Resting potential restored
- Prolonged plateau characteristic of cardiac muscle

**Slide reference:** Slide 18 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 10.8: Calcium Release into Cytosol—T-Tubule Propagation

The signal propagates along the membrane's interior via diffusion of sodium (Na⁺) from the original action potential, resulting in additional local depolarization along the membrane where new action potentials can form, allowing Na⁺ to be replenished stepwise from the cell's exterior. This process continues down into the cell's T-tubules. At the site of the original action potential, the plateau phase has been reached. The membrane depolarization and subsequent action potential generation proceed progressively deeper into the cell through the T-tubule system, ensuring that the electrical signal reaches all regions of the cell interior.

**Key details:**

- Signal propagates via Na⁺ diffusion from initial action potential site
- Causes local depolarization along membrane
- New action potentials generated stepwise
- Na⁺ replenished from extracellular space
- Process continues into T-tubules
- Original action potential site reaches plateau phase
- Progressive signal penetration into cell interior

**Slide reference:** Slide 19 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 10.9: Calcium Release into Cytosol—Deep T-Tubule Regions

Through diffusion flow of sodium ions (Na⁺), even the deeper parts of the T-tubules become depolarized and action potentials are triggered there as well. This includes first the opening of voltage-gated Na⁺ channels (not shown in diagram) and then the opening of voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels. Opening of the voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels results in small amounts of calcium (Ca²⁺) diffusing into the cell. At sites of earlier action potentials, the plateau phase is ongoing. The small amount of extracellular Ca²⁺ entering through these channels will trigger much larger Ca²⁺ release from the adjacent sarcoplasmic reticulum, amplifying the signal.

**Key details:**

- Na⁺ diffusion depolarizes deep T-tubule regions
- Action potentials triggered in T-tubules
- Voltage-gated Na⁺ channels open (rapid upstroke)
- Voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels open (plateau phase)
- Small amount of Ca²⁺ enters from outside
- Earlier action potential sites remain in plateau phase
- Entering Ca²⁺ triggers larger SR Ca²⁺ release

**Slide reference:** Slide 20 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 10.10: Calcium-Induced Calcium Release from Sarcoplasmic Reticulum

Part of the calcium (Ca²⁺) that diffuses in from the cell's exterior (shown in pink/rose in the diagram) stimulates Ca²⁺ channels on nearby sarcoplasmic reticulum to open. This in turn causes Ca²⁺ to diffuse out from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol in amounts sufficient

for contraction to initiate. The Ca²⁺ channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum change their opening state based on whether they bind Ca²⁺ on the cytosolic side or not—if Ca²⁺ is bound, they are open, and vice versa. This mechanism is called calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), where a small calcium trigger from outside causes amplified calcium release from internal stores. This amplification ensures that adequate calcium is available throughout the cell for contraction.

**Key details:**

- Extracellular Ca²⁺ entering cell (trigger calcium)
- Stimulates Ca²⁺ channels on SR membrane
- SR Ca²⁺ channels open in response to cytosolic Ca²⁺ binding
- Massive Ca²⁺ release from SR into cytosol
- Amount sufficient to initiate contraction
- Mechanism: calcium-induced calcium release (CICR)
- Ca²⁺ binding opens SR channels; no Ca²⁺ binding closes them
- Amplification of initial signal

**Slide reference:** Slide 21 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 10.11: Complete Signaling in Contractile Cardiac Myocyte Summary

The complete signaling sequence in a contractile cardiac muscle cell can be summarized in five steps. Step 1: Positive ions diffuse in from neighboring cells via gap junctions. Step 2: Depolarization opens voltage-gated Na⁺ channels, triggering an action potential. Step 3: The signal propagates down into T-tubules through repeated action potentials. Step 4: Depolarization opens voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels, allowing Ca²⁺ influx. Step 5: "Receptor-regulated" Ca²⁺ channels on the sarcoplasmic reticulum open in response to the Ca²⁺ that entered during step 4. This sequence transforms an electrical signal at the cell surface into a chemical signal (elevated cytosolic calcium) that triggers contraction throughout the cell volume.

**Key details:**

- Step 1: Positive ion influx from neighbors via gap junctions
- Step 2: Voltage-gated Na⁺ channels open → action potential
- Step 3: Signal propagates into T-tubules via repeated action potentials
- Step 4: Voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels open → Ca²⁺ influx
- Step 5: SR Ca²⁺ channels open (triggered by step 4 Ca²⁺)
- Transforms electrical signal to chemical signal (Ca²⁺)
- Enables contraction throughout cell

**Slide reference:** Slide 22 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 10.12: Termination of Cardiac Muscle Cell Contraction

The termination of cardiac muscle cell contraction involves reversing the calcium elevation that initiated contraction. Step 1: The signal chain that previously led to Ca²⁺ release is interrupted, thereby stopping Ca²⁺ influx to the cytosol. Step 2: Cytosolic Ca²⁺ initiates contraction of the cardiac muscle cell. Step 3: The cytosolic Ca²⁺ is pumped back out of the cytosol through multiple mechanisms—ATP-dependent Ca²⁺ pumps move calcium back into the SR, ATP-dependent pumps in the plasma membrane move calcium out of the cell, and Na⁺-dependent Ca²⁺ exchange uses the sodium gradient to extrude calcium. Step 4: Muscle contraction ceases when Ca²⁺ disappears from the cytosol. This active removal of calcium requires significant ATP expenditure and ensures that the heart can relax between beats.

**Key details:**

- Step 1: Signal chain interrupted → Ca²⁺ influx stops
- Step 2: Cytosolic Ca²⁺ initiates contraction
- Step 3: Cytosolic Ca²⁺ actively removed:
    - ATP-dependent Ca²⁺ pumps → back to SR
    - ATP-dependent pumps → out of cell
    - Na⁺-dependent Ca²⁺ exchange → out of cell
- Step 4: Contraction ceases when cytosolic Ca²⁺ removed
- Active process requiring ATP
- Enables cardiac relaxation

## Topic 11: Differences Between Cardiac and Skeletal Muscle

### Overview

While cardiac and skeletal muscle both contain sarcomeres and use calcium-dependent contraction mechanisms, they differ fundamentally in their action potential characteristics and capacity for sustained contraction. Cardiac muscle cannot be allowed to remain in a contracted state because this would halt the heart's pumping function, whereas skeletal muscle can maintain sustained contractions (tetanus) useful for static muscle work like holding a position. These functional differences arise from distinct action potential durations: cardiac muscle has a prolonged action potential lasting several hundred milliseconds due to the plateau phase, while skeletal muscle has a brief action potential lasting only a few milliseconds. The long refractory period of cardiac muscle (during which a new action potential cannot be generated) prevents repetitive stimulation and tetanic contraction, ensuring that the heart has adequate time to fill with blood between contractions. Additionally, cardiac muscle sarcomeres have a different length-tension relationship than skeletal muscle, which underlies the Frank-Starling mechanism whereby increased ventricular filling automatically produces stronger contraction.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 11.1: Necessity for Preventing Cardiac Muscle Tetanus

Cardiac muscle cannot be allowed to remain in a contracted state because such a state would lead to cessation of the heart's pumping function. If cardiac muscle could undergo tetanus (sustained contraction), the ventricles would remain contracted and unable to fill with blood, eliminating cardiac output. In contrast, skeletal muscle can in certain situations benefit from constant contraction, for example during static muscle work where a sustained force must be maintained. The inability of cardiac muscle to tetanize is a critical safety feature ensuring continuous pumping function. This fundamental difference reflects the distinct physiological roles of these two muscle types.

**Key details:**

- Cardiac muscle cannot sustain contraction (no tetanus)
- Sustained contraction would stop pumping function
- Would prevent ventricular filling
- Skeletal muscle can sustain contraction (tetanus)
- Tetanus useful for static work in skeletal muscle
- Cardiac muscle protected from tetanus by long refractory period

**Slide reference:** Slide 24 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 11.2: Action Potential Duration Differences

The action potential appearance differs markedly between muscle cell types. In skeletal muscle cells, the action potential lasts only a few milliseconds, with rapid depolarization via voltage-gated Na⁺ channels, brief peak, and rapid repolarization via voltage-gated K⁺ channels. Acetylcholine-regulated Na⁺ influx at the neuromuscular junction initiates the skeletal muscle action potential. In contractile cardiac muscle cells, the action potential lasts several hundred milliseconds due to the plateau phase, during which simultaneous Ca²⁺ influx and K⁺ outflow maintain depolarization. Diffusion of ions from neighboring cells via gap junctions initiates the cardiac action potential (no neuromuscular junction). This dramatic difference in duration (approximately 100-fold) accounts for the difference in susceptibility to tetanic contraction.

**Key details:**

- Skeletal muscle action potential:
    - Duration: few milliseconds
    - Initiated by acetylcholine at neuromuscular junction
    - Rapid Na⁺ influx and K⁺ outflow
    - No plateau phase
- Contractile cardiac muscle action potential:
    - Duration: several hundred milliseconds (~200-300 ms)
    - Initiated by ion diffusion from neighbors via gap junctions
    - Na⁺ influx, then Ca²⁺ influx and K⁺ outflow simultaneously (plateau)
    - Prolonged plateau phase
- ~100-fold duration difference

**Slide reference:** Slide 25 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 11.3: Refractory Period and Prevention of Tetanus

The refractory period is the period during which no new action potential can be formed. In skeletal muscle cells, the action potential and refractory period are brief (few milliseconds), allowing rapid repetitive stimulation that can produce summation of contractions leading to tetanus (sustained contraction). In cardiac muscle cells, the action potential and refractory period are prolonged (several hundred milliseconds), occupying most of the contraction-relaxation cycle. The cardiac muscle cell's long refractory period makes it impossible for new contractions to begin before the previous contraction is over, preventing tetanus. This ensures that cardiac muscle always has time to relax and the heart chambers have time to refill between beats.

**Key details:**

- Refractory period: time when new action potential cannot form
- Skeletal muscle:
    - Short refractory period (few milliseconds)
    - Allows rapid repetitive stimulation
    - Summation possible → tetanus can occur
- Cardiac muscle:
    - Long refractory period (several hundred milliseconds)
    - New contraction impossible before previous ends
    - Tetanus cannot occur
    - Ensures relaxation and refilling time

**Slide reference:** Slide 26 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 11.4: Sarcomere Length and Contraction Force Relationship

The relationship between sarcomere length and contraction force varies depending on sarcomere structure. Depending on how long the sarcomere is, its contraction force will vary. This phenomenon depends partly on the amount of possible interactions between actin and myosin filaments, but also has other causes related to calcium sensitivity and geometric factors. A graph of sarcomere length versus contraction force shows an optimal length range where force is maximal, with reduced force at both shorter and longer lengths. The normal sarcomere length range in skeletal muscles attached to bones falls within the ascending limb and plateau of this curve.

**Key details:**

- Sarcomere length affects contraction force
- Depends on actin-myosin interaction possibilities
- Also depends on calcium sensitivity and geometry
- Optimal length range for maximal force
- Shorter or longer than optimal: reduced force
- Skeletal muscle sarcomere length: usually in optimal range

**Slide reference:** Slide 27 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 11.5: Cardiac versus Skeletal Muscle Sarcomere Length-Tension Relationship

The sarcomere in a cardiac muscle cell differs slightly from the counterpart in a skeletal muscle cell, resulting in a different relationship between sarcomere length and contraction force. For skeletal muscle, the length-tension curve shows a relatively flat plateau at intermediate lengths. For cardiac muscle, the length-tension curve continues to rise steeply even at longer sarcomere lengths within the physiological range. The normal sarcomere length in cardiac muscle cells typically operates on the ascending portion of the length-tension curve. This relationship enables the Frank-Starling law of the heart, where greater ventricular filling (which stretches cardiac sarcomeres) leads to stronger contraction automatically.

**Key details:**

- Cardiac sarcomeres differ structurally from skeletal sarcomeres
- Skeletal muscle: relatively flat length-tension plateau
- Cardiac muscle: steep ascending length-tension relationship
- Cardiac sarcomere length: on ascending limb in physiological range
- Greater stretch → greater force in cardiac muscle
- Enables Frank-Starling mechanism
- Automatic matching of output to input

**Slide reference:** Slide 28 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 11.6: Frank-Starling Law of the Heart

The phenomenon where greater ventricular filling leads to stronger cardiac muscle contraction is called the Frank-Starling law of the heart. First, increased blood delivery to the ventricle causes cardiac muscle cells in the ventricular walls to be stretched, elongating their sarcomeres. Second, the contraction force of individual sarcomeres increases with their increasing length due to the cardiac muscle length-tension relationship. This mechanism leads to the ventricle pumping out approximately the same amount of blood as was delivered to it, maintaining balance between venous return and cardiac output. The Frank-Starling mechanism operates intrinsically within the heart without requiring nervous or hormonal input, providing automatic matching of cardiac output to venous return.

**Key details:**

- Frank-Starling law: increased filling → stronger contraction
- Step 1: Increased blood delivery stretches ventricular walls
- Cardiac muscle cells elongated
- Sarcomeres lengthened
- Step 2: Sarcomere contraction force increases with length
- Result: ventricle pumps out what was delivered
- Intrinsic mechanism (no nervous/hormonal control needed)
- Automatic matching of output to input

## Topic 12: Electrocardiography (ECG)

### Overview

Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG) is a non-invasive technique for recording the electrical activity of the heart by placing electrodes on the body surface. The depolarizations and repolarizations occurring in different parts of the heart generate electrical currents strong enough to be detected on the skin surface. By attaching electrodes at defined positions on the body (typically right arm RA, left arm LA, right leg RL, and left leg LL, plus six chest positions), these electrical changes can be recorded and displayed as waveforms. A normal ECG shows characteristic deflections: the P wave (atrial depolarization), the QRS complex (ventricular depolarization), and the T wave (ventricular repolarization). ECG is invaluable for detecting arrhythmias (heart rhythm disturbances), conduction abnormalities, myocardial infarction, and other cardiac pathologies. Understanding the relationship between cardiac electrical events and ECG waveforms allows clinicians to assess cardiac function and diagnose cardiovascular diseases.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 12.1: Principles of Electrocardiography

Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG) exploits the fact that depolarizations and repolarizations in the heart's different parts generate electrical currents strong enough to be registered on the body's surface. By attaching electrodes at different defined positions on the body surface, these electrical changes can be recorded. The electrode positions typically include right arm (RA), left arm (LA), right leg (RL), and left leg (LL), plus six chest positions (V1-V6). This examination method is called electrocardiography. The recorded waveforms reflect the sum of all electrical activity in the heart at each moment in time, with different electrode combinations (leads) providing different perspectives on this electrical activity.

**Key details:**

- Cardiac depolarizations and repolarizations generate detectable currents
- Currents strong enough to register on body surface
- Electrodes placed at defined positions:
    - RA (right arm), LA (left arm)
    - RL (right leg), LL (left leg)
    - Six chest positions (V1-V6)
- Method called electrocardiography (ECG/EKG)
- Different leads provide different electrical perspectives

**Slide reference:** Slide 30 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 12.2: ECG Waveform Components

The electrocardiogram's appearance consists of characteristic waves corresponding to specific cardiac events. The P wave represents depolarization of the atrial musculature. The QRS complex represents depolarization of the ventricular musculature. The T wave represents repolarization of the ventricular musculature. Atrial repolarization typically occurs during the QRS complex and is obscured by the larger ventricular depolarization signal. The timing and morphology of these waves provide information about conduction pathways, chamber sizes, and cardiac function. Deviations from normal waveform patterns indicate various cardiac pathologies.

**Key details:**

- P wave: atrial depolarization (atrial musculature depolarizes)
- QRS complex: ventricular depolarization (ventricular musculature depolarizes)
- T wave: ventricular repolarization (ventricular musculature repolarizes)
- Atrial repolarization: hidden within QRS complex
- Waveform timing and morphology indicate cardiac function
- Abnormalities suggest cardiac pathology

## Topic 13: Autonomic Regulation of Heart Function

### Overview

The autonomic nervous system continuously modulates cardiac function through both sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways, adjusting heart rate, conduction velocity, and contraction strength to meet physiological demands. The sympathetic nervous system innervates most of the heart through direct nerve pathways and indirectly through adrenaline released from the adrenal medulla, binding to beta-1 adrenergic receptors to increase heart rate (positive chronotropic effect), increase contraction strength (positive inotropic effect), and increase AV node conduction velocity. The parasympathetic nervous system innervates only the SA node and AV node through the vagus nerve, binding to M2 muscarinic receptors to decrease heart rate (negative chronotropic effect) and slow AV conduction. At the cellular level, sympathetic signaling increases intracellular cAMP production, which enhances calcium influx and speeds depolarization, while parasympathetic signaling decreases cAMP and increases potassium efflux, slowing depolarization. Understanding autonomic cardiac regulation is essential for comprehending how the cardiovascular system responds to stress, exercise, and various pathological conditions.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 13.1: Autonomic Innervation of the Heart

The heart's autonomic innervation involves both sympathetic and parasympathetic components. The sympathetic nervous system innervates the majority of the heart via direct nerve pathways from sympathetic ganglia near the spinal cord, and "indirectly" via adrenaline released from the adrenal medulla into the bloodstream. The parasympathetic nervous system innervates only the SA node and AV node through nerve pathways from the vagus nerve (nervus vagus). This differential innervation pattern means that sympathetic stimulation can affect both heart rate and contractility throughout the heart, while parasympathetic stimulation primarily affects heart rate and AV nodal conduction without directly affecting ventricular contraction strength.

**Key details:**

- Sympathetic nervous system:
    - Innervates most of heart
    - Direct pathways from sympathetic ganglia
    - Indirect via adrenaline from adrenal medulla
- Parasympathetic nervous system:
    - Innervates only SA node and AV node
    - Pathway: vagus nerve (nervus vagus)
- Differential innervation determines functional effects
- Sympathetic: affects rate and contractility
- Parasympathetic: primarily affects rate and conduction

**Slide reference:** Slide 32 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 13.2: Examples of Autonomic Heart Regulation

The autonomic nervous system regulates cardiac function through multiple mechanisms. The sympathetic nervous system increases the heart's minute volume (cardiac output) by: (1) increasing heart rate through increased number of action potentials generated in the SA node, and (2) increasing stroke volume by increasing calcium ion (Ca²⁺) influx in individual contractile cardiac muscle cells—more tropomyosin molecules are displaced from actin filaments and sarcomeres shorten to a greater extent. The parasympathetic nervous system decreases the heart's minute volume by: (1) decreasing heart rate through reduced number of action potentials generated in the SA node. The parasympathetic system has no direct effect on contractility due to its limited innervation pattern (SA and AV nodes only).

**Key details:**

- Sympathetic nervous system increases minute volume via:
    1. Increased heart rate (more SA node action potentials)
    2. Increased stroke volume (increased Ca²⁺ influx → stronger contraction)
        - More tropomyosin displaced
        - Greater sarcomere shortening
- Parasympathetic nervous system decreases minute volume via:
    1. Decreased heart rate (fewer SA node action potentials)
- Parasympathetic has no direct ventricular contractility effect

**Slide reference:** Slide 33 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 13.3: Summary of Autonomic Cardiac Regulation

The autonomic regulation of the heart can be summarized by signaling pathways and receptors. The sympathetic nervous system uses adrenaline and noradrenaline as signaling substances, which bind to beta-1 adrenergic receptors on cardiac cells. This produces increased heart rate (positive chronotropic effect) at the SA node, stronger contractions (positive inotropic effect) at contractile cardiac muscle cells, and increased conduction velocity (positive dromotropic effect) at the AV node. The parasympathetic nervous system uses acetylcholine as its signaling substance, which binds to M2 muscarinic receptors. This produces decreased heart rate (negative chronotropic effect) at the SA node and decreased conduction velocity (negative dromotropic effect) at the AV node. No effect on contractile cells occurs because these lack parasympathetic innervation.

**Key details:**

- Sympathetic nervous system:
    - Signaling substances: Adrenaline, Noradrenaline
    - Receptor: Beta-1 (β₁) adrenergic receptor
    - Effects: Increased heart rate (SA node), stronger contractions (contractile cells), increased conduction (AV node)
- Parasympathetic nervous system:
    - Signaling substance: Acetylcholine
    - Receptor: M2 muscarinic receptor
    - Effects: Decreased heart rate (SA node), decreased conduction (AV node)
    - No effect on contractile cells (no innervation)

**Slide reference:** Slide 34 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 13.4: Autonomic Effects on SA Node Pacemaker Potential

The autonomic nervous system influences heart rate by modifying the pacemaker potential slope in SA node cells. Under normal basal autonomic nerve activity, SA node cells spontaneously depolarize via leaky Na⁺ channels, with Ca²⁺ channels opening at threshold and K⁺ channels causing repolarization. Increased sympathetic nerve activity increases heart rate by opening additional Na⁺ channels, causing threshold to be reached faster and action potentials to occur more frequently. Increased parasympathetic nerve activity decreases heart rate by opening K⁺ channels, which hyperpolarizes the membrane and causes threshold to be reached more slowly, reducing action potential frequency. The balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic tone determines the actual heart rate, which is typically around 70 beats/min at rest rather than the intrinsic SA node rate of 100 beats/min.

**Key details:**

- Normal basal activity: ~70 beats/min (balanced autonomic tone)
- Increased sympathetic activity:
    - Opens additional Na⁺ channels
    - Steeper pacemaker potential slope
    - Threshold reached faster
    - Higher heart rate
- Increased parasympathetic activity:
    - Opens K⁺ channels
    - Membrane hyperpolarization
    - Threshold reached slower
    - Lower heart rate
- Autonomic balance determines actual heart rate

**Slide reference:** Slide 35 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 13.5: Detailed Mechanisms of Heart Rate Regulation

The detailed cellular mechanisms of autonomic heart rate regulation involve specific ion channel modulation. Sympathetic nerve signaling leads to opening of sodium (Na⁺) channels through noradrenaline and adrenaline binding to beta-1 receptors, increasing depolarization rate. The membrane potential rises from approximately -60 mV toward threshold more rapidly, with action potentials occurring more frequently. Parasympathetic nerve signaling leads to opening of potassium (K⁺) channels through acetylcholine binding to M2 receptors. This causes membrane hyperpolarization (moving away from threshold) and slows the rate of depolarization, with action potentials occurring less frequently. These opposing influences allow fine control of heart rate over a wide range.

**Key details:**

- Sympathetic signaling:
    - Noradrenaline/adrenaline bind β₁ receptors
    - Opens Na⁺ channels
    - Faster depolarization rate
    - More frequent action potentials
    - Higher heart rate
- Parasympathetic signaling:
    - Acetylcholine binds M2 receptors
    - Opens K⁺ channels
    - Membrane hyperpolarization
    - Slower depolarization rate
    - Less frequent action potentials
    - Lower heart rate

**Slide reference:** Slide 36 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 13.6: Sympathetic Signaling Increases Heart Rate via cAMP Pathway

Sympathetic signaling increases heart rate through a G-protein coupled receptor cascade. First, binding of adrenaline or noradrenaline to the beta-1 receptor activates a stimulatory G-protein (Gs). Second, Gs stimulates the process leading to production of cAMP (cyclic AMP) and ultimately activation of PKA (protein kinase A) through adenylate cyclase activation. Third, PKA opens sodium (Na⁺) channels by phosphorylating them. Note that cAMP can also open Na⁺ channels directly by binding to them. This signaling pathway increases the rate of pacemaker depolarization, causing more frequent action potentials and increased heart rate. The cAMP-PKA pathway also enhances calcium handling in contractile cells, increasing contraction strength.

**Key details:**

- Step 1: Adrenaline/Noradrenaline bind Beta-1 receptor
- Activates stimulatory G-protein (Gs)
- Step 2: Gs stimulates adenylate cyclase
- Produces cAMP
- cAMP activates PKA (protein kinase A)
- Step 3: PKA phosphorylates and opens Na⁺ channels
- Alternative: cAMP directly opens Na⁺ channels
- Increases pacemaker depolarization rate
- Result: increased heart rate

**Slide reference:** Slide 37 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 13.7: Parasympathetic Signaling Decreases Heart Rate

Parasympathetic signaling decreases heart rate through antagonistic G-protein signaling. First, binding of acetylcholine to the M2 receptor leads to activation of an inhibitory G-protein (Gi). Second, Gi inhibits adenylate cyclase, thereby counteracting cAMP formation and opposing the sympathetic pathway. Third, Gi can also stimulate opening of a specific potassium (K⁺) channel directly. The inhibition of cAMP production reduces Na⁺ channel opening, while K⁺ channel opening hyperpolarizes the membrane. Both effects slow the rate of pacemaker depolarization, decreasing action potential frequency and heart rate.

**Key details:**

- Step 1: Acetylcholine binds M2 receptor
- Activates inhibitory G-protein (Gi)
- Step 2: Gi inhibits adenylate cyclase
- Reduces cAMP formation
- Opposes sympathetic pathway
- Step 3: Gi also stimulates specific K⁺ channel opening
- K⁺ efflux hyperpolarizes membrane
- Result: slower pacemaker depolarization, decreased heart rate

**Slide reference:** Slide 38 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 13.8: Combined Autonomic Signaling in SA Node

The SA node receives simultaneous input from both sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions, with their opposing effects on ion channels determining the final heart rate. Sympathetic signaling through beta-1 receptors and Gs proteins increases cAMP production and PKA activity, leading to increased Na⁺ channel opening and faster depolarization. Parasympathetic signaling through M2 receptors and Gi proteins decreases cAMP production (by inhibiting adenylate cyclase) and directly opens K⁺ channels, slowing depolarization. The balance between these pathways determines the depolarization rate of autorhythmic cardiac muscle cells, and thus the heart rate. At rest, parasympathetic tone dominates, reducing the intrinsic 100 beats/min to approximately 70 beats/min.

**Key details:**

- Both systems act simultaneously on SA node
- Sympathetic pathway:
    - β₁ receptor → Gs → cAMP → PKA
    - Opens Na⁺ channels
    - Increases depolarization rate
- Parasympathetic pathway:
    - M2 receptor → Gi
    - Inhibits adenylate cyclase (reduces cAMP)
    - Opens K⁺ channels
    - Decreases depolarization rate
- Balance determines final heart rate
- Resting: parasympathetic dominance (~70 bpm)

**Slide reference:** Slide 39 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 13.9: Schematic Overview of SA Node Innervation

The schematic overview of SA node innervation shows the anatomical pathways of autonomic control. Sympathetic ganglia near the spinal cord send sympathetic nerve fibers to the SA node, where they release noradrenaline that binds to β₁ receptors on autorhythmic cardiac muscle cells. Parasympathetic ganglia (located near or within the heart) receive input from the vagus nerve originating in the CNS, then send short parasympathetic fibers to the SA node where they release acetylcholine that binds to M2 receptors. Each SA node cell receives innervation from both divisions, allowing integrated control. This dual innervation pattern allows rapid, fine-tuned adjustments of heart rate in response to physiological demands.

**Key details:**

- Sympathetic pathway:
    - CNS → sympathetic ganglia (near spinal cord) → SA node
    - Releases noradrenaline
    - Binds β₁ receptors on SA node cells
- Parasympathetic pathway:
    - CNS → vagus nerve → parasympathetic ganglia (near heart) → SA node
    - Releases acetylcholine
    - Binds M2 receptors on SA node cells
- Dual innervation allows fine-tuned control
- Both divisions act on same target cells

**Slide reference:** Slide 40 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 13.10: Inotropic and Chronotropic Effects Defined

The terms inotropic and chronotropic describe different types of effects on cardiac function. Inotropic effect refers to an effect on cardiac muscle contraction strength (force of contraction). Chronotropic effect refers to an effect on cardiac muscle contraction frequency (heart rate). The parasympathetic nervous system produces negative chronotropic effects (decreases heart rate) but has no inotropic effect because it does not innervate ventricular muscle. The sympathetic nervous system produces both positive chronotropic effects (increases heart rate) and positive inotropic effects (increases contraction strength). These terms are commonly used in clinical cardiology to describe drug and physiological effects on the heart.

**Key details:**

- Inotrop human: effect on contraction strength (force)
- Chronotropic effect: effect on contraction frequency (rate)
- Parasympathetic nervous system:
    - Negative chronotropic effect (decreases heart rate)
    - No inotropic effect (doesn't innervate ventricles)
- Sympathetic nervous system:
    - Positive chronotropic effect (increases heart rate)
    - Positive inotropic effect (increases contraction strength)
- Clinical terminology for describing cardiac effects

## Topic 14: Pharmacological Agents Affecting the Heart

### Overview

Various pharmaceutical agents can modulate cardiac function by targeting specific cellular mechanisms that regulate heart rate and contraction strength. Cardiac glycosides (such as digitalis/digoxin) inhibit the sodium-potassium pump, leading to increased intracellular sodium, which secondarily reduces calcium extrusion and increases intracellular calcium, producing a positive inotropic effect. Anticholinergic drugs (such as atropine) block M2 muscarinic receptors, preventing parasympathetic effects and resulting in increased heart rate (positive chronotropic effect). Beta-blockers are antagonists to beta-adrenergic receptors, blocking sympathetic effects and producing both negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects, making them useful for treating hypertension, angina, and certain arrhythmias. Understanding these pharmacological mechanisms is essential for rational drug therapy in cardiovascular disease and for recognizing potential side effects and drug interactions.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 14.1: Examples of Drugs Affecting the Heart

Several categories of drugs affect cardiac function through different mechanisms. Cardiac glycosides, exemplified by digitalis (Digoxin), primarily produce positive inotropic effects (increased contraction strength). These drugs inhibit the sodium/potassium pump (Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase), which leads to increased intracellular sodium concentration. The increased intracellular sodium reduces the driving force for the sodium-calcium exchanger that normally exports calcium from the cell, resulting in increased intracellular calcium and stronger contractions. Anticholinergic drugs such as atropine are antagonists to M2 muscarinic receptors, blocking parasympathetic effects and resulting in reduced parasympathetic signaling, which produces positive (increased) chronotropic effects (increased heart rate). Beta-blockers are antagonists to beta-adrenergic receptors and produce both negative inotropic and chronotropic effects by blocking sympathetic stimulation.

**Key details:**

- Cardiac glycosides (e.g., digitalis/Digoxin):
    - Inhibit Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase pump
    - Increase intracellular Na⁺
    - Reduce Ca²⁺ extrusion
    - Increase intracellular Ca²⁺
    - Positive inotropic effect
- Anticholinergics (e.g., atropine):
    - M2 receptor antagonists
    - Block parasympathetic effects
    - Positive chronotropic effect (increased heart rate)
- Beta-blockers:
    - Beta receptor antagonists
    - Block sympathetic effects
    - Negative inotropic and chronotropic effects

**Slide reference:** Slide 42 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 14.2: Mechanism of Beta-Blocker Action

Beta-blockers decrease heart rate by blocking beta-1 adrenergic receptors on autorhythmic cardiac muscle cells in the SA node. In the absence of beta-blockers, noradrenaline and adrenaline released from sympathetic nerve terminals and the adrenal medulla respectively bind to β₁ receptors on SA node cells, activating the Gs-cAMP-PKA pathway that increases Na⁺ channel opening and accelerates pacemaker depolarization. When beta-blockers are present, these drugs bind to β₁ receptors and prevent activation by noradrenaline and adrenaline, blocking the sympathetic stimulatory pathway. This prevents the sympathetic increase in heart rate and contractility, effectively producing negative chronotropic and inotropic effects. Beta-blockers are widely used to treat hypertension, angina, heart failure, and certain arrhythmias.

**Key details:**

- Without beta-blocker:
    - Noradrenaline/adrenaline bind β₁ receptors
    - Activates Gs-cAMP-PKA pathway
    - Opens Na⁺ channels
    - Increases heart rate
- With beta-blocker present:
    - Beta-blocker binds β₁ receptors
    - Prevents noradrenaline/adrenaline binding
    - Blocks sympathetic pathway
    - Prevents heart rate and contractility increases
- Beta-blocker = Beta-1 antagonist
- Clinical uses: hypertension, angina, heart failure, arrhythmias

**Slide reference:** Slide 43 (Lecture 12)

## Topic 15: Cardiac Arrhythmias

### Overview

Cardiac arrhythmias are abnormalities of heart rhythm that can arise from various mechanisms including abnormal automaticity, reentry circuits, or conduction blocks. Arrhythmias are classified by their site of origin (supraventricular versus ventricular) and by their effect on heart rate (bradycardia, tachycardia, or fibrillation). Supraventricular arrhythmias originate in the atria or AV node, while ventricular arrhythmias originate in the ventricles. Bradycardia (fewer than 60 beats per minute) can result from decreased SA node automaticity or conduction blocks, while tachycardia (more than 100 beats per minute) results from increased automaticity or reentry mechanisms. Fibrillation represents irregular and typically faster rhythm due to chaotic electrical activity—atrial fibrillation is common and usually not immediately life-threatening, but acute ventricular fibrillation causes cardiac arrest and requires immediate defibrillation to restore organized rhythm. Understanding arrhythmia mechanisms is essential for appropriate diagnosis and treatment selection.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 15.1: Classification of Arrhythmias

Arrhythmia (heart rhythm disturbance) can be classified in multiple ways. By origin, arrhythmias are divided into supraventricular arrhythmia (originating in any part of the heart except the ventricles, including atria, SA node, or AV node) and ventricular arrhythmia (originating in the ventricles). By effect on heart rate, they are classified as bradycardia (fewer than 60 beats per minute), tachycardia (more than 100 beats per minute), or fibrillation (irregular and often faster pulse where electrical activity is chaotic). Acute ventricular fibrillation causes cardiac arrest and can be terminated through defibrillation (delivery of electrical shock to reset the heart's electrical system). Different arrhythmias have different clinical significances and require different treatments.

**Key details:**

- Classification by origin:
    - Supraventricular arrhythmia: originates outside ventricles (atria, SA node, AV node)
    - Ventricular arrhythmia: originates in ventricles
- Classification by rate effect:
    - Bradycardia: <60 beats/min
    - Tachycardia: >100 beats/min
    - Fibrillation: irregular, often faster, chaotic electrical activity
- Acute ventricular fibrillation:
    - Causes cardiac arrest
    - Requires defibrillation (electrical shock)
- Different arrhythmias require different treatments

## Topic 16: Coronary Circulation and Myocardial Blood Supply

### Overview

The heart muscle requires its own dedicated blood supply, provided by the coronary arteries that branch from the aorta immediately after the aortic valve. The right and left coronary arteries (a. coronaria dexter and sinister) arise from the aortic root and course along the heart surface, with the anterior interventricular branch (ramus interventricularis anterior) being a major branch. These arteries branch extensively to supply all regions of the myocardium with oxygen and nutrients. Coronary blood flow occurs primarily during diastole when the heart muscle is relaxed, as ventricular contraction during systole compresses intramural vessels and impedes flow. Venous drainage from the myocardium occurs primarily through the coronary sinus (sinus coronarius), which empties into the right atrium. Coronary artery disease, characterized by atherosclerotic plaque buildup in coronary vessels, can lead to reduced myocardial blood flow (ischemia), causing chest pain (angina) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) when blood flow is completely blocked.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 16.1: Coronary Arteries and Myocardial Blood Supply

The heart muscle's blood supply is provided by coronary arteries, also called coronary vessels. These vessels originate from the aorta immediately after the aortic valve and include the right coronary artery (a. coronaria dexter) and left coronary artery (a. coronaria sinister). The anterior interventricular branch (ramus interventricularis anterior) is a major branch of the left coronary artery that courses down the anterior surface between the ventricles. These coronary vessels are open only during diastole because ventricular contraction during systole compresses the vessels within the heart wall. Venous drainage occurs through the coronary sinus (sinus coronarius) which empties into the right atrium. This coronary circulation is essential for maintaining the high metabolic demands of cardiac muscle.

**Key details:**

- Coronary arteries/coronary vessels supply heart muscle blood
- Origin: from aorta immediately after aortic valve
- Right coronary artery (a. coronaria dexter)
- Left coronary artery (a. coronaria sinister)
- Ramus interventricularis anterior: major branch on anterior surface
- Open only during diastole (compressed during systole)
- Venous drainage: coronary sinus → right atrium
- Essential for cardiac muscle metabolism

**Slide reference:** Slide 45 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 16.2: Coronary Circulation Pathway

The coronary circulation pathway shows how blood flows through the heart muscle's vascular system. The left coronary artery (a. coronaria sinister) and right coronary artery (a. coronaria dexter) branch from the aorta. The anterior interventricular branch (ramus interventricularis anterior) runs along the heart's anterior surface. After passing through myocardial capillaries, venous blood collects in the coronary sinus (sinus coronarius), which drains into the right atrium (atrium dexter). From there, deoxygenated blood follows the normal pathway through the right ventricle (ventriculus sinister) back to the lungs via the pulmonary circulation, then to the left heart for redistribution to the systemic circulation including back to the coronary arteries. This arrangement ensures continuous perfusion of the heart muscle itself.

**Key details:**

- Aorta → left and right coronary arteries
- Ramus interventricularis anterior (anterior interventricular branch)
- Myocardial capillaries
- Coronary sinus → right atrium
- Blood then follows: right ventricle → lungs → left heart → systemic circulation
- Continuous perfusion of myocardium
- Coronary circulation part of systemic circulation

**Slide reference:** Slide 46 (Lecture 12)

## Topic 17: Atherosclerosis and Coronary Artery Disease

### Overview

Atherosclerosis is a progressive disease process involving the buildup of lipid-rich plaques in arterial walls, which can narrow or completely block blood flow. In coronary arteries, this process leads to coronary artery disease, a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The pathogenesis involves endothelial dysfunction, LDL cholesterol infiltration and oxidation, monocyte recruitment and transformation into foam cells (lipid-laden macrophages), smooth muscle cell proliferation, and eventual plaque formation. These plaques can rupture, triggering thrombosis (blood clot formation) that can completely occlude the vessel. When a coronary artery is blocked, the myocardium supplied by that vessel becomes ischemic (inadequate blood flow) and hypoxic (inadequate oxygen), potentially leading to myocardial infarction (heart attack) if blood flow is not restored promptly. Cells downstream of the occlusion cannot produce sufficient ATP through aerobic metabolism and may die, resulting in permanent cardiac damage.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 17.1: LDL-Dependent Vessel Narrowing (Atherosclerosis)

The process of LDL-dependent vessel narrowing involves multiple steps in plaque formation. Step 1: LDL particles ("bad cholesterol") infiltrate the arterial wall endothelium. Step 2: Monocytes from the blood are recruited to the vessel wall and differentiate into macrophages. Step 3: Macrophages ingest oxidized LDL and become foam cells (lipid-laden macrophages). Step 4: Smooth muscle cells proliferate and a plaque forms, consisting of lipids, foam cells, smooth muscle cells, and connective tissue. The plaque impedes blood flow and can also break loose, forming an embolus. Blood platelets aggregate at sites of plaque rupture, forming thrombi that can completely block vessels. This atherosclerotic process is the underlying cause of most coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and many strokes.

**Key details:**

- Step 1: LDL ("bad cholesterol") infiltrates vessel wall
- Step 2: Monocytes recruited, become macrophages
- Step 3: Macrophages ingest oxidized LDL → foam cells (skumceller)
- Step 4: Smooth muscle cell proliferation, plaque formation
- Plaque components: lipids, foam cells, smooth muscle, connective tissue
- Plaque impedes blood flow
- Plaque can rupture → thrombosis
- Blood platelets aggregate → blood clot/thrombus formation
- Can completely block vessel

**Slide reference:** Slide 47 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 17.2: Consequences of Blocked Blood Vessel

A blood clot (thrombus) or hemorrhage (with subsequent clot formation) makes effective blood supply to a specific area impossible. The result is ischemia (low blood supply to the tissue) and hypoxia (low oxygen level in the tissue). Cells downstream from the blood clot will not receive sufficient oxygen supply and risk dying due to insufficient ATP production. When cardiac muscle cells die from inadequate blood supply, the condition is called myocardial infarction (heart attack). Similar mechanisms cause stroke when brain vessels are occluded. The extent of tissue damage depends on the size of the affected vessel, the presence of collateral circulation, and how quickly blood flow is restored.

**Key details:**

- Blood clot or hemorrhage blocks vessel
- Ischemia: low blood supply to tissue
- Hypoxia: low oxygen level in tissue
- Insufficient oxygen supply to cells downstream
- Risk of cell death due to insufficient ATP production
- Myocardial infarction: death of cardiac muscle from blocked coronary artery
- Extent of damage depends on vessel size, collaterals, and time to reperfusion

**Slide reference:** Slide 48 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 17.3: Consequences of Hypoxia on Glucose Metabolism

Low tissue oxygenation (hypoxia) results in incomplete oxidation of glucose in cells and insufficient ATP production. Under normal aerobic conditions, glucose is completely oxidized through glycolysis (producing 2 ATP and 2 pyruvate) followed by the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain (producing approximately 30-32 additional ATP per glucose). During hypoxia, the electron transport chain cannot function because oxygen is the final electron acceptor. Without oxygen, NADH cannot be regenerated to NAD⁺ through the electron transport chain. Cells must rely solely on glycolysis, which produces only 2 ATP per glucose and converts pyruvate to lactate (lactic acid) to regenerate NAD⁺. This anaerobic metabolism is far less efficient than aerobic metabolism and cannot sustain cardiac muscle function, leading to contractile failure and eventual cell death if prolonged.

**Key details:**

- Hypoxia → incomplete glucose oxidation
- Glycolysis produces 2 ATP (continues during hypoxia)
- Pyruvate converted to lactate (lactic acid/mjölksyra)
- NADH must be regenerated to NAD⁺ for glycolysis to continue
- Without O₂: electron transport chain non-functional
- Cannot regenerate NAD⁺ via electron transport chain
- Total ATP production: only 2 ATP per glucose (versus ~32 with oxygen)
- Insufficient for cardiac muscle demands
- Leads to contractile failure and cell death

## Topic 18: Additional Muscles (Neck, Back, Pelvic Floor)

### Overview

Beyond the cardiac and abdominal muscles, several other muscle groups are anatomically significant. The sternocleidomastoid muscle (m. sternocleidomastoideus) in the neck enables head flexion and rotation and can assist with forced inspiration. The erector spinae muscle group (musculi erector spinae) consists of multiple muscles running along the vertebral column that stabilize the spine and enable various spinal movements. The pelvic floor musculature, including the coccygeus muscle (m. coccygeus) and levator ani muscle (m. levator ani), supports pelvic organs and maintains continence. Understanding these muscles' anatomical origins, insertions, and functions is essential for comprehensive understanding of human movement, posture, and organ support systems.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 18.1: Sternocleidomastoid Muscle

The musculus sternocleidomastoideus (sternocleidomastoid muscle/sneda halsmuskeln/nickmuskeln) has its origin at the manubrium sterni (upper part of the sternum/breastbone) and the medial part of the clavicula (clavicle/collarbone). Its insertion point is the mastoid process (processus mastoideus) on the temporal bone (os temporale). The function of this muscle includes flexion and rotation of the head, and it can also assist with powerful/forced inspiration by elevating the rib cage. This prominent neck muscle is easily visible when the head is rotated to one side and is important for head movement and positioning.

**Key details:**

- Muscle: Musculus sternocleidomastoideus (sternocleidomastoid/neck muscle)
- Origin: Manubrium sterni (upper sternum) and medial clavicula (clavicle)
- Insertion: Processus mastoideus on os temporale (temporal bone)
- Function:
    - Head flexion and rotation
    - Assists with forced inspiration
- Prominent, visible neck muscle

**Slide reference:** Slide 50 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 18.2: Erector Spinae Muscles

The musculi erector spinae (erector spinae muscles/ryggsträckaren) constitute a group of muscles with origin on the hip bone (os coxae), all spinal vertebrae (vertebrae), and ribs. They insert on all spinal vertebrae, ribs, and parts of the cranium. The function includes stabilizing the spinal column and performing multiple movements of the spine including extension, lateral flexion, and rotation. This muscle group extends from the sacrum to the skull and consists of three main columns: iliocostalis, longissimus, and spinalis. These muscles are essential for maintaining upright posture and enabling spinal movements.

**Key details:**

- Muscle: Musculi erector spinae (erector spinae/back straightener)
- Origin: Os coxae (hip bone), all spinal vertebrae, ribs
- Insertion: All spinal vertebrae, ribs, parts of cranium
- Function:
    - Stabilizes spinal column

**Slide reference:** Slide 51 (Lecture 12)

#### Subtopic 18.3: Pelvic Floor Musculature

The pelvic floor musculature includes the coccygeus muscle (musculus coccygeus/svansbensmuskeln) and the levator ani muscle (musculus levator ani/anushöjaren). These muscles have their origin on the inside of the hip bone (os coxae) and insert on the anterior part of the sacrum (os sacrum/korsbenet) and the coccyx (os coccygis/svansbenet). Their function is to support and lift the pelvic floor, which supports the pelvic organs (bladder, rectum, and in females the uterus and vagina). These muscles also play important roles in maintaining urinary and fecal continence and in sexual function. The pelvic floor forms a muscular hammock that closes the inferior pelvic outlet while allowing passage of the urethra, rectum, and vagina.

**Key details:**

- Function:
    - Supports and lifts pelvic floor
    - Supports pelvic organs (bladder, rectum, uterus/vagina)
    - Maintains continence
    - Sexual function
- Forms muscular pelvic floor
- Allows passage of urethra, rectum, and vagina

## Topic 19: Systemic Circulation Arteries and Blood Flow Distribution (Lecture 13)

### Overview

The systemic circulation consists of an extensive network of arteries that branch progressively from the aorta to deliver oxygenated blood to all body tissues. The aorta, as the first and largest artery, plays a critical role in converting the pulsatile output from the left ventricle into relatively continuous flow through its elastic properties. Large muscular arteries branch from the aorta to supply specific regions: the head and arms via branches from the aortic arch, the thoracic and abdominal organs via the descending aorta, and the legs via the common iliac arteries. These vessels then branch repeatedly through progressively smaller arteries and arterioles until reaching capillary beds. Blood flow velocity varies inversely with total cross-sectional area, being fastest in the aorta and slowest in capillaries where the aggregate cross-sectional area is greatest. Understanding the anatomical organization and hemodynamic principles of systemic arterial circulation is fundamental for comprehending cardiovascular physiology and pathology.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 19.1: Overview of Pulmonary and Systemic Circulation Structure

The circulatory system consists of two circuits: the pulmonary circulation (small circuit) and systemic circulation (large circuit), both connected to the heart. The pulmonary circulation pathway includes the right ventricle pumping blood through two pulmonary arteries (via the pulmonary trunk) to pulmonary arterioles and lung capillaries where gas exchange occurs, then returning through pulmonary venules and four pulmonary veins to the left atrium. The systemic circulation pathway includes the left ventricle pumping through the aorta to systemic arteries, arterioles, tissue capillaries (where exchange occurs), then returning through venules, veins, and two vena cavae to the right

atrium. These circuits operate in series, ensuring all blood passes through both circuits sequentially.

**Key details:**

- Two circuits: pulmonary (small) and systemic (large)
- Pulmonary circulation:
    - Right ventricle → pulmonary trunk → 2 pulmonary arteries → arterioles → lung capillaries → venules → 4 pulmonary veins → left atrium
    - Function: gas exchange with alveoli
- Systemic circulation:
    - Left ventricle → aorta → arteries → arterioles → tissue capillaries → venules → veins → 2 vena cavae → right atrium
    - Function: deliver O₂ and nutrients, remove CO₂ and waste
- Circuits operate in series

**Slide reference:** Slides 1-2 (Lecture 13)

#### Subtopic 19.2: Blood Flow Velocity in Systemic Circulation

Blood flow velocity in the systemic circulation varies inversely with the total cross-sectional area of vessels at each level. The aorta has the smallest total cross-sectional area and highest flow velocity (approximately 35 cm/second). As arteries branch into arterioles and then into millions of capillaries, the aggregate cross-sectional area increases dramatically (reaching approximately 5000 cm² in capillaries), and flow velocity decreases correspondingly (to less than 1 mm/second in capillaries). After capillaries, vessels converge into venules and veins, decreasing total cross-sectional area and increasing velocity again. The slow capillary flow velocity is functionally important, allowing adequate time for exchange of gases, nutrients, and wastes between blood and tissues.

**Key details:**

- Flow velocity inversely related to total cross-sectional area
- Aorta: highest velocity (~35 cm/s), smallest area
- Progressive branching increases total cross-sectional area
- Capillaries: lowest velocity (~0.1 cm/s), largest total area (~5000 cm²)
- Slow capillary flow allows time for exchange
- Convergence into veins increases velocity again
- Functional significance: matching velocity to function

**Slide reference:** Slide 3 (Lecture 13)

## Topic 20: The Aorta as an Elastic Artery

### Overview

The aorta, as the first and largest artery in the systemic circulation, has specialized elastic properties that serve critical hemodynamic functions. During ventricular systole, approximately seventy-five percent of the stroke volume is temporarily "stored" in the aorta as its elastic walls expand to accommodate the ejected blood. This expansion is possible because the aorta wall contains abundant elastin fibers in the extracellular matrix. During diastole, the expanded aorta recoils to its original diameter, maintaining blood pressure and continuing to propel blood forward even though the heart is not actively ejecting. This elastic reservoir function converts the intermittent pumping action of the heart into relatively continuous blood flow throughout the systemic circulation. With aging, the amount of elastic fibers in the aorta decreases, reducing this capacitance function and requiring higher systolic pressures to achieve the same degree of expansion, contributing to systolic hypertension in elderly individuals.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 20.1: Aorta Wall Structure and Elasticity

The aorta wall contains abundant elastic fibers, giving it the capacity to expand during systole to receive blood flowing out of the left ventricle. During systole, the aorta expands as blood is ejected; approximately seventy-five percent of the stroke volume from the systemic circulation is "stored" or "warehoused" in the aorta while blood is pumped out to the aorta during systole. This storage capacity depends on the elastic properties of the aorta wall, specifically the high elastin content in the tunica media. The original size of the aorta before systole and the expanded aorta after systole demonstrate this elastic reservoir function. The elasticity allows the aorta to function as both a conduit and a pressure reservoir.

**Key details:**

- Aorta wall: abundant elastic fibers (high elastin content)
- Capacity to expand during systole
- ~75% of stroke volume temporarily "stored" in aorta
- Wall distends to accommodate ejected blood
- Original diameter pre-systole vs. expanded diameter post-systole
- Elastic reservoir function
- High compliance (ΔV/ΔP) compared to other arteries

**Slide reference:** Slide 4 (Lecture 13)

#### Subtopic 20.2: Aorta Ensures Continuous Blood Flow

The aorta transforms the discontinuous blood flow from the heart into continuous flow in the systemic circulation. During diastole, the aorta returns to its previous diameter as blood flows onward toward the veins. When the volume in the aorta decreases through elastic recoil, blood pressure is maintained at a sufficiently high level for continued effective blood flow even during diastole when the heart is not actively ejecting. This "Windkessel" effect (from the German term for air chamber) smooths out the pulsatile flow from the heart. The elastic recoil maintains diastolic pressure, ensuring that tissues receive continuous perfusion rather than intermittent flow that would be inefficient for exchange.

**Key details:**

- Aorta converts discontinuous heart output to continuous systemic flow
- During diastole: aorta returns to original diameter
- Elastic recoil propels blood forward during diastole
- Maintains blood pressure during diastole
- Ensures continuous effective blood flow
- "Windkessel" effect smooths pulsatile flow
- Maintains diastolic pressure and tissue perfusion

**Slide reference:** Slide 5 (Lecture 13)

## Topic 21: Blood Pressure in Systemic Circulation

### Overview

Blood pressure represents the force exerted by blood against vessel walls and varies systematically throughout the systemic circulation. Pressure is highest in the left ventricle during systole and in the aorta and large arteries (systolic pressure ~120 mmHg, diastolic pressure ~80 mmHg), drops progressively through arterioles (which provide the major resistance to flow), reaches its lowest levels in capillaries (allowing filtration and exchange), remains low in veins, and reaches near-zero levels in the right atrium. The mean arterial pressure represents the average pressure during the cardiac cycle and can be calculated as diastolic pressure plus one-third of pulse pressure (systolic minus diastolic pressure). Blood pressure increases with age as elastic fibers in the aorta decrease, requiring higher systolic pressures to achieve the same degree of aortic expansion. Hypertension (persistently elevated blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg) increases cardiovascular risk and is a major public health concern worldwide.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 21.1: Systemic Circulation Blood Pressure Overview

Blood pressure in the systemic circulation decreases progressively from the left ventricle through to the right atrium. Pressure values (in mmHg relative to atmospheric pressure) show: left ventricle peaks at 120 mmHg during systole and drops to near 0 during diastole, arteries maintain 80-120 mmHg (diastolic to systolic), arterioles show a steep pressure drop from ~80 to ~40 mmHg, capillaries have pressure around 25-35 mmHg, venules and veins have low pressure (5-15 mmHg), and the right atrium has pressure near 0 mmHg. Systolic pressure is the peak pressure during ventricular contraction, diastolic pressure is the minimum pressure during ventricular relaxation, and mean pressure represents the average pressure over the cardiac cycle. The large pressure drop across arterioles reflects their role as the major site of vascular resistance.

**Key details:**

- Pressure decreases progressively through systemic circulation
- Left ventricle: 0-120 mmHg (diastole-systole)
- Arteries: 80-120 mmHg (diastolic-systolic pressure)
- Arterioles: steep drop from ~80 to ~40 mmHg (major resistance site)
- Capillaries: ~25-35 mmHg (allows filtration)
- Venoler-veins: 5-15 mmHg (low pressure)
- Right atrium: ~0-5 mmHg (near zero)
- Systolic, diastolic, and mean pressures defined

## Topic 22: Muscular Arteries of Systemic Circulation

### Overview

Muscular arteries are medium-sized arteries characterized by three to forty layers of smooth muscle cells in the tunica media. These vessels conduct blood from the elastic arteries (like the aorta) to smaller arterioles and eventually to capillary beds throughout the body. The substantial smooth muscle layer serves two main functions: resisting the high blood pressure within arteries to prevent vessel rupture, and maintaining vessel patency when subjected to external compression (such as when a joint bends or external pressure is applied). Major muscular arteries include the common carotid arteries supplying the head and neck, the subclavian and brachial arteries supplying the upper limbs, the celiac trunk and mesenteric arteries supplying abdominal organs, and the femoral and tibial arteries supplying the lower limbs. Understanding the anatomical distribution of these vessels is clinically important for localizing vascular lesions, understanding referred pain patterns, and planning surgical or interventional procedures.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 22.1: Muscular Artery Structure and Function

Muscular arteries contain three to forty layers of smooth muscle cells in the tunica media and conduct oxygen-rich blood to different parts of the body. The smooth muscles in these vessels serve to withstand the high blood pressure in the artery so that the vessel wall does not rupture. Additionally, the smooth muscle ensures that relevant arteries remain open during external loading, such as when the knee joint artery must remain patent during knee flexion and extension. These arteries are called "muscular" because smooth muscle is their predominant structural component, distinguishing them from elastic arteries (like the aorta) where elastic fibers predominate. The muscular walls can also undergo vasoconstriction or vasodilation in response to various stimuli, contributing to blood flow regulation.

**Key details:**

- 3-40 layers of smooth muscle cells in tunica media
- Conduct oxygen-rich blood to body regions
- Functions:
    1. Withstand high blood pressure (prevent rupture)
    2. Maintain patency under external compression
- Example: knee joint artery remains open during flexion
- Distinguished from elastic arteries by predominant smooth muscle
- Can vasoconstrict/vasodilate for flow regulation

**Slide reference:** Slide 7 (Lecture 13)

#### Subtopic 22.2: Arteries to Upper Body from Aortic Arch

The aortic arch (arcus aortae) gives rise to arteries supplying the upper body. The ascending aorta (aorta ascendens) emerges from the left ventricle. The brachiocephalic trunk (truncus brachiocephalicus) is the first branch, dividing into the right common carotid artery (a. carotis communis dx) supplying the right head/neck and the right subclavian artery (a. subclavia dx) supplying the right arm. The left common carotid artery (a. carotis communis sin) arises directly from the arch to supply the left head/neck. The left subclavian artery (a. subclavia sin) supplies the left arm. The left subclavian continues as the left axillary artery (a. axillaris sin), which gives rise to the left radial artery (a. radialis sin) and left ulnar artery (a. ulnaris sin) in the forearm, with the brachial artery (a. brachialis sin) as an intermediate vessel. The terms "dexter" (dx) and "sinister" (sin) mean right and left respectively in Latin.

**Key details:**

- Aortic arch (arcus aortae) branches:
    1. Truncus brachiocephalicus (brachiocephalic trunk)
        - → A. carotis communis dx (right common carotid)
        - → A. subclavia dx (right subclavian)
    2. A. carotis communis sin (left common carotid)
    3. A. subclavia sin (left subclavian)
- Left arm arterial sequence:
    - A. subclavia sin → A. axillaris sin → A. brachialis sin → A. radialis sin & A. ulnaris sin
- Latin terms: dexter (dx) = right, sinister (sin) = left
- Supplies upper extremities and head/neck

**Slide reference:** Slide 8 (Lecture 13)

#### Subtopic 22.3: Detailed Anatomy of Arm and Head/Neck Arteries

The detailed arterial anatomy shows the brachiocephalic trunk (truncus brachiocephalicus) branching into the right subclavian (a. subclavia dx) and right common carotid (a. carotis communis dx). The left subclavian (a. subclavia sin) and left common carotid (a. carotis communis sin) arise directly from the arch. In the arm, the subclavian continues as the axillary artery (a. axillaris), then becomes the brachial artery (a. brachialis) in the upper arm, which divides into the radial (a. radialis) and ulnar (a. ulnaris) arteries in the forearm. The ascending aorta (aorta ascendens) and aortic arch (arcus aortae) connect these vessels to the left ventricle. Understanding this branching pattern is essential for clinical assessment of peripheral pulses and understanding stroke mechanisms.

**Key details:**

- Truncus brachiocephalicus → A. subclavia dx & A. carotis communis dx
- A. carotis communis sin arises separately from arch
- A. subclavia sin arises separately from arch
- Upper limb sequence: Subclavia → Axillaris → Brachialis → Radialis & Ulnaris
- Bilateral symmetry in arm arteries (dx and sin)
- Clinical relevance: pulse assessment, stroke etiology

**Slide reference:** Slide 9 (Lecture 13)

#### Subtopic 22.4: Head and Neck Arterial Supply

The arterial supply to the head and neck begins with the common carotid artery (a. carotis communis), which bifurcates into the internal carotid artery (a. carotis interna) supplying deep structures including the brain, and the external carotid artery (a. carotis externa) supplying the superficial parts of the head and neck including facial structures. The vertebral artery (a. vertebralis) branches from the subclavian artery (a. subclavia) and ascends through the cervical vertebrae to supply the brainstem and cerebellum, joining with its contralateral counterpart to form the basilar artery (a. basilaris). The circle of Willis (circulus arteriosus) at the base of the brain receives blood from both the internal carotid and basilar arteries, giving rise to the anterior cerebral artery (a. cerebri anterior), middle cerebral artery (a. cerebri media), and posterior cerebral artery (a. cerebri posterior) that supply different regions of the cerebral hemispheres. This arrangement provides collateral circulation possibilities if one vessel becomes occluded.

**Key details:**

- A. carotis communis bifurcates into:
    - A. carotis interna (internal carotid): supplies brain
    - A. carotis externa (external carotid): supplies superficial head/neck
- A. subclavia → A. vertebralis:
    - Ascends through cervical vertebrae
    - Supplies brainstem and cerebellum
    - Joins contralateral vertebral → A. basilaris
- Circulus arteriosus (Circle of Willis):
    - Receives blood from internal carotids and basilar
    - Gives rise to A. cerebri anterior, media, posterior
    - Provides collateral circulation potential

**Slide reference:** Slide 10 (Lecture 13)

#### Subtopic 22.5: Cerebral Hemisphere Arterial Territories

The cerebral hemispheres receive blood from three major arteries, each supplying specific regions. The anterior cerebral artery (a. cerebri anterior) supplies the medial and superior surfaces of the frontal and parietal lobes. The middle cerebral artery (a. cerebri media) supplies the lateral surface of the hemisphere including motor cortex (controlling voluntary movement), Broca's area (speech production), Wernicke's area (language comprehension), and auditory cortex. The posterior cerebral artery (a. cerebri posterior) supplies the occipital lobe including visual cortex. Loss of blood supply to a specific area of the brain leads to rapid death of nerve cells in that region due to their high metabolic demands and lack of glucose/oxygen storage. The resulting loss of function corresponds to the affected region—for example, middle cerebral artery stroke typically causes contralateral motor weakness and aphasia.

**Key details:**

- A. cerebri anterior: medial/superior frontal and parietal lobes
- A. cerebri media: lateral hemisphere including:
    - Motor cortex
    - Broca's area (speech production/talcentrum)
    - Wernicke's area (language comprehension/språkförståelse)
    - Auditory cortex (hörselbarken)
- A. cerebri posterior: occipital lobe (visual cortex/synbarken)
- Loss of blood supply → rapid nerve cell death
- Loss of function corresponds to affected region
- Clinical correlation with stroke syndromes

**Slide reference:** Slide 11 (Lecture 13)

#### Subtopic 22.6: Abdominal Arteries from Descending Aorta

The descending aorta continues through the thorax and abdomen as the abdominal aorta (aorta abdominalis), giving off major branches to abdominal organs. The celiac trunk (truncus coeliacus) is the first major abdominal branch, supplying the stomach, pancreas, liver, and spleen. The superior mesenteric artery (a. mesenterica superior) supplies parts of the intestines. The right and left renal arteries (a. renalis dexter and sinister) supply the kidneys, with each kidney receiving its own dedicated arterial branch. The inferior mesenteric artery (a. mesenterica inferior) supplies additional parts of the intestines, particularly the distal colon. The aorta ascendens connects to the left heart, and the arcus aortae connects the ascending and descending segments. This organization ensures that all abdominal organs receive adequate blood supply.

**Key details:**

- Aorta abdominalis (abdominal aorta): continuation of thoracic aorta
- Major branches (proximal to distal):
    1. Truncus coeliacus (celiac trunk):
        - Supplies stomach, pancreas, liver, spleen
    2. A. mesenterica superior (superior mesenteric):
        - Supplies parts of intestines
    3. A. renalis dx & sin (renal arteries):
        - Each kidney receives dedicated artery
    4. A. mesenterica inferior (inferior mesenteric):
        - Supplies distal intestines
- Connects: Aorta ascendens → Arcus aortae → Aorta descendens → Aorta abdominalis

**Slide reference:** Slide 12 (Lecture 13)

#### Subtopic 22.7: Detailed Abdominal Arterial Anatomy

The detailed anatomy of abdominal arteries shows the abdominal aorta (aorta abdominalis) descending through the abdomen and giving off paired and unpaired branches. The left renal artery (a. renalis sin) supplies the left kidney. The celiac trunk (truncus coeliacus) is an unpaired vessel supplying upper abdominal organs. The superior mesenteric artery (a. mesenterica superior) is unpaired and supplies much of the small intestine and proximal colon. The inferior mesenteric artery (a. mesenterica inferior) is unpaired and supplies the distal colon and rectum. This branching pattern reflects the embryological development of the gut tube and its blood supply. Understanding this anatomy is essential for interpreting abdominal imaging and planning surgical procedures.

**Key details:**

- Aorta abdominalis: descends through abdomen
- Paired branches: A. renalis dx & sin (to kidneys)
- Unpaired branches (anterior, supplying GI tract):
    - Truncus coeliacus (to stomach, liver, spleen, pancreas)
    - A. mesenterica superior (to small intestine, proximal colon)
    - A. mesenterica inferior (to distal colon, rectum)
- Reflects embryological gut development
- Clinical relevance: surgical planning, imaging interpretation

**Slide reference:** Slide 13 (Lecture 13)

#### Subtopic 22.8: Lower Extremity Arterial Supply

The arterial supply to the lower extremities begins with the abdominal aorta bifurcating into the right and left common iliac arteries (a. iliaca communis dexter and sinister). Each common iliac divides into an internal iliac artery (a. iliaca interna) supplying parts of the pelvis and gluteal muscles, and an external iliac artery (a. iliaca externa) continuing as the femoral artery (a. femoralis) in the thigh. The femoral artery becomes the popliteal artery (a. poplitea) behind the knee, which then divides into the anterior tibial artery (a. tibialis anterior) and posterior tibial artery (a. tibialis posterior) in the lower leg. The anterior tibial continues as the dorsalis pedis artery (a. dorsalis pedis) on the dorsum of the foot. This sequential branching pattern ensures blood supply to all regions of the lower limb.

**Key details:**

- Aorta abdominalis bifurcates into:
    - A. iliaca communis dx & sin (common iliac arteries)
- Each common iliac divides into:
    - A. iliaca interna (internal iliac): pelvis, gluteal muscles
    - A. iliaca externa (external iliac): continues to leg
- Lower limb arterial sequence:
    - A. iliaca externa → A. femoralis → A. poplitea → A. tibialis anterior & posterior
    - A. tibialis anterior → A. dorsalis pedis (foot)
- Sequential branching supplies all lower limb regions

**Slide reference:** Slide 14 (Lecture 13)

#### Subtopic 22.9: Detailed Lower Extremity Arterial Anatomy

The detailed anatomy shows the abdominal aorta (aorta abdominalis) bifurcating into right and left common iliac arteries (a. iliaca communis dx and sin). Each divides into an internal iliac artery (a. iliaca interna) supplying pelvic structures and an external iliac artery (a. iliaca externa) continuing into the thigh as the femoral artery (a. femoralis). The femoral artery passes through the thigh and becomes the popliteal artery (a. poplitea) in the posterior knee region. Below the knee, the popliteal bifurcates into anterior tibial (a. tibialis anterior) and posterior tibial (a. tibialis posterior) arteries. The anterior tibial continues as the dorsalis pedis (a. dorsalis pedis) artery on the foot dorsum, where a pulse can be palpated clinically. Understanding this anatomy is essential for assessing peripheral arterial disease and performing vascular interventions.

**Key details:**

- Complete lower limb arterial pathway:
    - Aorta abdominalis → A. iliaca communis (dx/sin)
    - → A. iliaca externa → A. femoralis → A. poplitea
    - → A. tibialis anterior & posterior
    - → A. dorsalis pedis (from anterior tibial)
- A. iliaca interna branches separately to pelvis
- Dorsalis pedis pulse: clinical assessment point
- Clinical relevance: peripheral arterial disease assessment

## Topic 23: Blood Pressure Measurement and Age-Related Changes

### Overview

Blood pressure measurement is a fundamental clinical assessment performed using a sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff) and stethoscope, based on the principle that inflating a cuff around the arm can temporarily occlude the brachial artery, with characteristic sounds (Korotkoff sounds) heard as pressure is released. Systolic pressure is recorded when sounds first appear (as blood begins to spurt through during peak systole), and diastolic pressure when sounds disappear (when flow becomes smooth and continuous). Normal blood pressure is approximately 120/80 mmHg, with hypertension defined as persistently elevated pressure above 140/90 mmHg. Blood pressure, particularly systolic pressure, increases with age due to decreased elastin content in the aorta, requiring higher pressures to achieve the same degree of aortic expansion. This age-related stiffening of arteries contributes to isolated systolic hypertension in elderly individuals and increases cardiovascular risk through increased afterload on the heart and pulsatile stress on vessel walls.

### Subtopics

#### Subtopic 23.1: Measurement of Arterial Blood Pressure

Arterial blood pressure is measured using a sphygmomanometer by inflating a cuff around the upper arm to compress the brachial artery. Step 1: The cuff is inflated above systolic pressure, completely occluding blood flow (no pulse sounds heard). Step 2: As cuff pressure is gradually released, a pulse wave can be heard through a stethoscope placed over the artery when cuff pressure drops below systolic pressure—blood spurts through during systole—and systolic blood pressure is recorded at this point (typically ~120 mmHg). Step 3: As cuff pressure continues to decrease, pulse sounds disappear when pressure falls below diastolic pressure because flow becomes continuous and smooth—diastolic blood pressure is recorded at this point (typically ~80 mmHg). The sounds heard between systolic and diastolic pressures are called Korotkoff sounds. This technique remains the standard for blood pressure measurement despite advances in automated devices.

**Key details:**

- Method: sphygmomanometer (cuff) and stethoscope
- Step 1: Inflate cuff above systolic pressure
    - Complete occlusion, no blood flow, no sounds
- Step 2: Deflate cuff gradually
    - First sounds heard = systolic pressure (~120 mmHg)
    - Blood spurts through during peak systole
- Step 3: Continue deflation
    - Sounds disappear = diastolic pressure (~80 mmHg)
    - Flow becomes continuous and smooth
- Sounds: Korotkoff sounds
- Standard clinical technique

#### Subtopic 23.2: Age-Related Changes in Arterial Blood Pressure

Blood pressure, particularly systolic pressure, changes with age. A graph showing blood pressure versus age (0-80 years) demonstrates that systolic pressure (upper line) increases progressively with age, while diastolic pressure (lower line) increases more modestly and may even decrease in advanced age. The amount of elastic fibers in the aorta wall decreases with aging, reducing the aorta's ability to expand and store blood during systole. Consequently, a higher pressure is required to create the "balloon effect" where blood is temporarily stored in the aorta during systole. This leads to increased systolic pressure and pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures) with age. The reference values for hypertension are 140/90 mmHg, though these thresholds may be interpreted differently in very elderly individuals. Age-related arterial stiffening is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease in older adults.

**Key details:**

- Blood pressure increases with age
- Systolic pressure: progressive increase with age
- Diastolic pressure: modest increase, may decrease in advanced age
- Mechanism: decreased elastic fibers in aorta with aging
    - Reduced aortic compliance/distensibility
    - Higher pressure needed for blood storage during systole
- Pulse pressure (systolic - diastolic) increases
- Hypertension threshold: 140/90 mmHg
- Age-related stiffening → increased cardiovascular risk

#### Subtopic 23.3: Mean Arterial Pressure and Pulse Pressure Calculations

Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure are important calculated hemodynamic parameters. Pulse pressure equals systolic pressure minus diastolic pressure. For example: Pulse pressure = 120 mmHg - 80 mmHg = 40 mmHg. Mean arterial pressure equals systolic pressure divided by three plus diastolic pressure times two divided by three, which weights diastolic pressure more heavily because diastole occupies approximately two-thirds of the cardiac cycle at normal heart rates. For example: MAP = (120 mmHg / 3) + (80 mmHg × 2 / 3) = 40 + 53.3 = 93 mmHg. Mean arterial pressure represents the average perfusion pressure over the cardiac cycle and is the driving force for blood flow through tissues. Pulse pressure reflects arterial stiffness and stroke volume.

**Key details:**

- Pulse pressure = Systolic pressure - Diastolic pressure
    - Example: 120 - 80 = 40 mmHg
    - Reflects arterial stiffness and stroke volume
- Mean arterial pressure (MAP) = (Systolic / 3) + (Diastolic × 2 / 3)
    - Example: (120 / 3) + (80 × 2 / 3) = 93 mmHg
    - Diastolic weighted more (2/3 of cycle time)
    - Represents average perfusion pressure
    - Driving force for tissue blood flow

#### Subtopic 23.4: Pressure Differences Between Pulmonary and Systemic Circulations

The pressure relationships differ dramatically between the two circulatory circuits. The systemic circulation is a high-pressure system with arterial blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, requiring a large pressure difference to drive flow between the beginning (left ventricle/aorta) and end (veins/right atrium) of the circuit. The heart diagram shows oxygen-rich blood (typically shown in red) in systemic arteries and oxygen-poor blood (typically shown in blue) returning via veins. The pulmonary circulation is a low-pressure system with arterial blood pressure of only 25/10 mmHg. The capillaries in the lungs require this lower pressure because they are extra thin to facilitate gas exchange, and higher pressures would risk causing pulmonary edema by forcing fluid into the alveoli. Despite lower pressures, the pulmonary circulation still effectively oxygenates all blood returning from systemic tissues.

**Key details:**

- Systemic circulation: high-pressure system
    - Arterial blood pressure: 120/80 mmHg
    - Large pressure gradient needed for flow
    - Left ventricle generates high pressure
- Pulmonary circulation: low-pressure system
    - Arterial blood pressure: 25/10 mmHg
    - Lower pressure required for thin lung capillaries
    - High pressure would risk pulmonary edema
    - Right ventricle generates lower pressure
- Different pressure requirements reflect different functions
