The sinus node, also called the sinoatrial (SA) node, is the heart's natural pacemaker located in the upper right chamber of the heart (the right atrium). Its main function is to generate and transmit the electrical impulses that cause the heart to beat in a regular rhythm. If the sinus node does not function properly, it can lead to an abnormally slow or irregular heartbeat, a condition known as sinus node dysfunction or sick sinus syndrome
